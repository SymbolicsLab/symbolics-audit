# ADR-002: Pre-Propositional Formalization (Open Thread)

**Status**: Open
**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Deciders**: Pending
**Context**: Scoping the formal layer; relationship between FDE work and the theory's foundations

---

## The Problem

Distinction is the primitive of the theory. It is pre-logical and pre-propositional—logic is *generated by* distinction, not the other way around.

FDE-fold (ADR-001) formalizes stabilization within an already-distinguished domain. It operates on configurations where atoms already exist. This is Level 2+ work: propositional structure that emerges *after* cuts have occurred.

But what about:
- **Level -1**: The pre-cut field (undifferentiated, prior to any distinction)
- **Level 0**: The act of distinction itself (cut as boundary-drawing, domain creation)
- **Level 1**: The immediate aftermath (first polarity, before stabilization)

These levels are where the theory's distinctive claims live. FDE cannot formalize them because FDE presupposes atoms. We need something else.

---

## Why This Matters

If we only formalize Level 2+, we risk:
1. **Mistaking the shadow for the thing**: Proving properties of stabilization while leaving distinction itself unformalized
2. **Losing the generative character**: The theory claims cut *creates* atoms; FDE treats atoms as given
3. **Blocking unfold**: Unfold may require reaching back toward the pre-propositional (domain expansion, reopening)

The theory's philosophical distinctiveness—that form emerges from distinction, not the reverse—requires formal grounding at Levels -1/0/1, not just Level 2+.

## Candidate Approaches (Updated after Cut-Fold Co-Constitution 2026-02-01)

### The Full Interface (CURRENT TARGET — ChatGPT + Opus synthesis)

**Source**: Session 1 final exchange — user insight on cut-fold co-constitution, ChatGPT discipline, Opus synthesis

**The key insight**: Cut and fold are **co-constitutive**. A cut is real at the meta-level but opaque from within its product. Fold creates internal witnesses (symbols) for the cut. This is **reflection/reification**, not retroactive creation.

**The typed interface that any formalization must satisfy**:

```agda
-- Domain evolution
World : Set

-- Pre-symbolic substrate (what cut operates on)
Opaque : World → Set

-- Propositional handles (what fold produces)
Atom : World → Set
Config : (w : World) → Set

-- Operations
cutW : World → World                           -- domain extension
cut : Opaque w → Opaque (cutW w)               -- substrate evolution
fold : Opaque w → Config w                     -- internalization (NOT invertible)
rem : Opaque w → Remainder w                   -- information loss (may be derived)
```

**What this captures**:
- `World` tracks domain evolution (which cuts have occurred)
- `Opaque w` is the pre-symbolic substrate at world-state `w`
- `Atom w` / `Config w` are the propositional layer
- `cut` evolves substrate; **not representable from within Config**
- `fold` maps substrate → propositional structure
- `rem` captures what fold erases

**The co-constitution claim, formally**: Fold is not left-invertible. Multiple `Opaque w` states can map to the same `Config w`. **Remainder is the fiber** — the multiplicity of pre-symbolic states behind each symbolic output. **Shimmer is the phenomenological trace of that multiplicity.**

**Assessment**: This is the target specification. The central open questions are: What is `Opaque`? What does `fold` preserve/erase?

### World-Indexed Atoms (SIMPLER ENTRY POINT)

**Source**: ChatGPT critique of Gemini's IR proposal (2026-02-01)

**A simpler version** that doesn't yet include `Opaque`:

```agda
World : Set
World = ℕ  -- simplest case

Atom : World → Set
Atom n = Fin n

cutW : World → World
cutW n = suc n

Config : World → Set
fold : {w : World} → Config w → Config w
```

**What this captures**:
- Pre-cut = `0` (no atoms)
- Each cut extends the domain
- Fold is domain-preserving

**Limitations**:
- No `Opaque` — doesn't capture pre-symbolic substrate
- No `rem` — doesn't capture remainder/opacity
- Atoms emerge "magically" from `World` without substrate story

**Assessment**: Sufficient for FDE-fold implementation. Upgrade to full interface when `Opaque` is specified.

### ~~Induction-Recursion~~ (DEMOTED — see ChatGPT critique)

**Source**: Gemini literature reconnaissance (2026-02-01)

**Problem identified by ChatGPT**:
1. The sketch wasn't actually Dybjer-style IR (just mutual recursion)
2. `Either (Observation w) (Observation w)` models **regions** (space doubles), not **atoms** (propositions)
3. FDE atoms correspond to cuts themselves, not to the 2ⁿ regions produced by n cuts

**The `Either` doubling intuition** may still be relevant for shimmer/remainder/topological aspects later, but it's the wrong generator for propositional atoms.

**Status**: Preserved for potential future use in "space of regions" formalization, but not the bridge to FDE-fold.

### Boundary Algebra / Laws of Form (Bricken)

**Source**: Bricken, "The Mathematics of Boundaries" (2001)

**Intuition**: Model the mark not as a function but as an **Inductive Type** (tree structure) with **Reduction Relations** (rewrite rules).

**Potential fit**:
- "Unmarked state" = rewrite rule target, not a set
- Calling: `(()) → ()`
- Crossing: `() () → void`
- Tree structure captures nesting

**Challenges**:
- Reduction relations harder to work with than functions
- Connection to type-theoretic semantics unclear

**Assessment**: Provides syntax; may complement Induction-Recursion (which provides semantics).

### Adjoint Functors (Lawvere)

**Source**: Lawvere, "Adjointness in Foundations" (1969)

**Intuition**: The act of distinction is a pair of **Adjoint Functors**. The "cut" is the **Free Functor** (Left Adjoint) moving from a simpler category to a more complex one.

**Potential fit**:
- Universal properties capture "canonical" distinction
- Well-developed mathematical theory
- Connects to category-theoretic semantics

**Challenges**:
- Very abstract
- Requires categorical infrastructure in Agda
- May not connect to phenomenology

**Assessment**: Theoretically elegant; may inform design but not be directly implementable.

### Cubical Interval Type

**Source**: Cubical Type Theory / Agda `--cubical`

**Intuition**: The Interval Type (`I`) has endpoints `i0` and `i1` that are distinct but cannot be case-split on. This is **pre-logical distinction**: the potential for distinction without Boolean decidability.

**Potential fit**:
- Captures "pre-logical" character
- Native to Cubical Agda
- Connects to HoTT path structure

**Challenges**:
- Requires `--cubical`, different from current `--without-K`
- May be too abstract for the phenomenology
- Significant learning curve

**Assessment**: Worth understanding, but may require flag changes.

### (Previous candidates preserved for reference)

#### Topological Semantics

**Intuition**: Distinction is boundary-drawing. The pre-cut field is a space. Cut partitions it.

**Challenges**: No standard Agda library; unclear what "points" are.

#### Game Semantics

**Intuition**: Distinction is interactive. Cut is a move in a game.

**Challenges**: What is the game? Who are the players?

#### Domain Theory

**Intuition**: Pre-cut field is domain with partial information ordering.

**Challenges**: May be too "computational" for phenomenology.

## What We Know

1. **FDE is not enough** for Levels -1/0/1. It presupposes what those levels generate.

2. **We don't have a spec** for the pre-propositional layer. "Topological" is a gesture, not a formalization.

3. **Unfold is the pressure point.** If unfold requires domain expansion or reaching back toward the pre-propositional, the FDE layer will hit a wall. That wall will clarify what's needed.

4. **The vault drafts contain clues:**
   - **Acquaintance**: Pre-cut as temporal phase, not epistemic relation
   - **Shimmer**: Phenomenological trace of the pre-propositional
   - **Fold as Dialogue**: Suggests interaction, not just function application

---

## The Central Formal Questions

### ~~Question 2 (DISSOLVED)~~: What does a single cut introduce?

**THIS QUESTION IS MALFORMED.** It presupposes that atoms are identical to cuts.

The theory is committed to a different ontology: **atoms are fold-stabilized names for boundary structure**, not direct products of cuts. See vault draft `Atom Ontology.md` for the full distinction.

Under this commitment:
- Cut introduces **boundary structure** (regions, partitions)
- Fold introduces **symbols** (atoms) as stable handles on that structure
- "How many atoms does cut introduce?" dissolves — cuts don't introduce atoms directly

### Question 1 (REFRAMED): What is the extraction map?

The central open formal question is now:

> **Given a world state `w` (accumulated boundary structure), what is the function that extracts a finite `Atom w` from it?**

```agda
-- The extraction map: Level 0 structure → Level 2 atoms
extract : World → Set
extract w = ???  -- THIS IS THE OPEN QUESTION
```

This is more fundamental than "what logic substrate?" The right logic is whatever respects the extraction map's structure.

| Approach | Extraction Map | Implications |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| `World = ℕ`, `Atom n = Fin n` | Trivial: each cut = one atom | Simple but may not capture boundary structure |
| `World = Tree`, `Atom w = Boundaries w` | Atoms name boundaries in tree | Captures "dog/not-dog" vs "inside/outside" |
| `World = BoundaryComplex`, `Atom w = StableNames w` | Atoms are fold-stable names | Most faithful to theory but complex |

### Question 0 (PRIOR): What is the type signature of cut?

Still important, but now understood as "what structure does cut add?" not "what atoms does cut create?":

| Signature | Ontological Commitment | Status |
|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| `A → A` | Cut is endofunction | **Fundamentally wrong** |
| `World → World × Atom` | Cut produces atoms directly | Wrong ontology (Term A) |
| `World → World` (structure only) | Cut extends boundary structure | **Correct** (Term B) |

**Key constraint**: Cut cannot produce atoms directly. Atoms are derived via extraction/stabilization.

See `Vault/00_inbox/drafts/Pre-propositional Constraints.md` and `Vault/00_inbox/drafts/Atom Ontology.md`.

## Working Materials

### Completed
- **Pre-propositional Constraints** (vault draft): Negative characterization + phenomenological requirements
- **Atom Ontology** (vault draft): Term A vs Term B — theory committed to Term B
- **Cut-Fold Co-Constitution** (vault draft): The typed interface specification
- **Gemini literature reconnaissance** (2026-02-01): Spencer-Brown, Bricken, Kauffman, Lawvere
- **ChatGPT critiques** (2026-02-01): Corrected IR sketch, disciplined co-constitution reframe
- **Induction-Recursion for Cut** (vault draft): DEMOTED — models regions, not atoms. Preserved for shimmer.
- **Laws of Form Formalizations** (vault draft): Source note synthesizing Bricken/Kauffman

### Key Findings (Cumulative)

**Gemini**: `Cut : A → A` is fundamentally wrong. Standard functions rearrange; they don't generate.

**ChatGPT (first critique)**: "Either-doubling" models regions, not atoms. Type mismatch with FDE.

**ChatGPT + Opus (atom ontology)**: The "1 vs 2 atoms" question presupposes wrong ontology. Atoms are fold-products, not cut-products.

**User insight (co-constitution)**: A cut doesn't exist *as nameable* within its product. The world isn't a blank canvas. A distinction arises between world and observer. Cut produces opacity; fold makes it visible.

**ChatGPT (co-constitution critique)**: Two interpretations — choose A (cut is real meta-event, fold creates witnesses) not B (fold retroactively creates cut). "Opacity" is doing four jobs; must disambiguate. The interface sketch is the deliverable.

**Opus (synthesis)**: Remainder-as-fiber may be the key unification. For a given `Config w`, the set `{ o : Opaque w | fold o = c }` *is* remainder. Shimmer is the phenomenological trace of that multiplicity.

### The Interface Specification

See vault draft `Cut-Fold Co-Constitution.md`. The typed interface:

```agda
World : Set
Opaque : World → Set
Atom : World → Set
Config : (w : World) → Set

cutW : World → World
cut : Opaque w → Opaque (cutW w)
fold : Opaque w → Config w  -- NOT left-invertible
```

**The co-constitution claim**: Fold is not invertible. Remainder = fiber of fold. Shimmer = phenomenological trace of remainder.

### The Handoff Problem (ChatGPT)

"If we don't formalize the boundary between Level 0/1 and Level 2+, Level 2+ will quietly become 'the real system.'"

**Solution**: The interface above. FDE-fold operates on `Config w`, which is well-defined even while `Opaque` remains unspecified.

---

## Decision (Current)

**Major clarification achieved (2026-02-01 evening): Cut-fold co-constitution specified.**

The theory is committed to:
1. **Term B**: Atoms are fold-stabilized names, not cut-products
2. **Interpretation A**: Cut is real at meta-level; fold creates internal witnesses (not retroactive creation)
3. **The typed interface**: World, Opaque, Atom, Config, cutW, cut, fold (see above)
4. **Remainder-as-fiber**: Non-invertibility of fold is the formal content of opacity

### What to do now:
1. **Proceed with FDE-fold implementation** — it operates on `Config w`, well-defined while `Opaque` remains open
2. Make FDE-fold parametric over atom type
3. Track where FDE-fold breaks — breakages constrain `Opaque` specification
4. Work toward specifying `Opaque : World → Set`
5. Formalize remainder (as fiber? as modality? as information-loss measure?)

### What FDE-fold now means:
FDE-fold is not just "Level 2+ approximation." It is `fold : Opaque w → Config w` restricted to the output side. It's the symbolic layer of the metabolism.

### What NOT to do:
- ~~Answer "how many atoms does cut introduce"~~ (DISSOLVED)
- Interpret co-constitution as "fold retroactively creates cut" (Interpretation B — rejected)
- Let "opacity" do four jobs without disambiguation
- Build multiple cut constructors — one primitive, derived modes
- Defer `Opaque` specification indefinitely

## Open Questions

### CENTRAL (the interface specification questions)

1. **What is `Opaque : World → Set`?**
   - The pre-symbolic substrate that cut operates on
   - This is the "input side" of the formalization
   - Candidates: raw region structure, boundary complex, topological space, game position

2. **What is `Remainder : World → Set`?**
   - Three options (per ChatGPT):
     - (i) Explicit data type (tracked information)
     - (ii) Logical modality (□ or ◇ on propositions)
     - (iii) Theorem about non-invertibility / information loss
   - Opus suggests: Remainder = fiber of fold. For `c : Config w`, the set `{ o : Opaque w | fold o = c }`

3. **Can the interface be implemented in Agda?**
   - What are `Opaque` and `Remainder` concretely?
   - This is the question that drives Session 2+

### DISSOLVED (no longer blocking)

2. ~~**Does a cut introduce ONE atom, TWO atoms (+/−), or atom + polarity?**~~
   - **DISSOLVED**: This question presupposes atoms are cut-products (Term A)
   - Under Term B (atoms are fold-stabilized names), the question is malformed
   - Replace with: "What structure does cut introduce, and how does fold extract atoms?"

### Important but not blocking

3. **What would a formalization of "cut creates structure" look like?**
   - PARTIALLY ANSWERED: `cut : World → World` extends boundary structure
   - OPEN: What is `World`? (ℕ? Tree? BoundaryComplex?)

4. **Is the pre-propositional formalizable at all, or is it necessarily extra-formal?**
   - Partially answered: The *interface* is formalizable. The "unmarked state" is context, not object.

5. **What constraints does the existing FDE layer place on the pre-propositional layer?**
   - ANSWERED: Make FDE parametric over `Atom w`. Constraints are explicit in the interface.

6. **Is "shimmer" (trace remainder) the formal bridge between layers?**
   - YES, likely: Shimmer is the boundary-structure that fold-stabilization doesn't capture
   - The "region-doubling" intuition (demoted for atoms) may be exactly right for shimmer
   - Shimmer = raw structure minus symbolized atoms

7. **Can the organizational hierarchy be formalized as a tower of increasingly structured objects?**
   - Level 0: Boundary structure (World)
   - Level 1: Extraction map (World → Atoms)
   - Level 2+: Symbolic operations (FDE-fold)
   - This is now the working model
