## Two-Body Problem

### Central Thesis

**The symbolic order is constitutively dyadic**: Transmissible, reusable, contestable symbolic form (distinction) cannot emerge from a single system, no matter how representationally sophisticated. It requires at least two systems under shared pressure coordinating such that one's differentiation becomes legible to the other. The first distinction is *recognized*, not *made*.

### Key Claims

#### Primary Structural Claims

1. **Differentiation vs. Distinction**: Differentiation is a one-body phenomenon (organism responding to environment through its index). Distinction is transmissible, reusable, contestable symbolic form that requires two bodies for its constitution.

2. **Three conditions for emergence**: Distinction emerges when:
   - **Shared pressure**: Two systems oriented to the same environmental or social demand
   - **Observability**: System A's differentiation is perceptible to System B
   - **Alignment**: System B can bring its index into sufficient alignment with System A's differentiation to treat it as informative

3. **Constitution vs. operation**: The two-body structure is constitutive at emergence, not at every subsequent use. Once constituted, distinctions can be operated on by individuals alone (inner speech, solitary thought).

4. **Normativity requires friction**: A solitary system can have habits but not rules. Rules require an external standard against which performance can be evaluated as correct or incorrect. The second body provides this normative friction.

5. **Diagnostic signatures of distinction**: Third-party portability, repair dynamics, context-stability, correctness independent of payoff, code plasticity. These appear reliably in dyads, not in solitary systems.

6. **Gradient from signal to distinction**: Signal (quorum sensing) -> Culturally maintained signal (waggle dance calibration) -> Proto-distinction (crow grudge, whale codas) -> Distinction (home sign, NSL, natural language).

#### Supporting Claims (Developmental)

7. Protoconversation (Trevarthen) demonstrates dyadic ground of distinction before language, theory of mind, or pointing.

8. Social referencing constitutes (not merely transmits) the distinction safe/dangerous in caregiver-infant interaction.

9. Tomasello's shared intentionality is not just a capacity facilitating transmission but a constitutive condition for symbolic content.

10. Enculturated apes (Kanzi) acquire quasi-symbolic capacities only with sustained dyadic interaction with symbolically competent partners. The bottleneck is interactional structure, not cognitive architecture.

11. Experimental semiotics demonstrates that single participants produce idiosyncratic systems; dyads under shared pressure produce stable, transmissible signs.

12. MARL experiments show signaling protocols emerge from multi-agent coordination, not single-agent optimization.

#### Supporting Claims (Animal Communication)

13. Vervet alarm call usage (not production) is socially refined. What is innate is the vocal form; what is dyadically constituted is the precise distinction.

14. Crow grudge transmission: the distinction "dangerous face" is constituted in dyadic interaction between experienced and naive crows and propagates through social networks.

15. Octopuses demonstrate that sophisticated differentiation without social structure does not produce distinction.

#### Supporting Claims (Evolutionary)

16. Signaling theory (Maynard Smith, Harper) defines signals by the sender-receiver relationship, not by what the sender produces alone.

17. Sensory exploitation: the first signal was recognized before it was made. The receiver's interpretive bias preceded the sender's communicative intent.

18. Signal-receiver co-evolution: neither sender nor receiver is prior; the communicative system is a two-body achievement.

19. Self-domestication hypothesis: reduced reactive aggression extended social tolerance, creating conditions for the two-body structure to operate.

### Formal Claims

1. **Falsifiability condition**: The discovery of a solitary species generating arbitrary, normative, contestable symbolic forms (exhibiting diagnostic signatures) without social interaction would falsify the hypothesis.

2. **Davidson's triangulation formalized**: Two creatures + shared stimulus + correlation of responses = possibility of error = objective content.

3. **Coupling-constitution distinction**: Removing the second body changes the *kind* of phenomenon (distinction -> differentiation), not merely its degree.

4. **LLMs lack triangulation**: The model has no index (no situated perspective from which it encounters the world). Without an index, there is no second vertex in the triangle.

### Novel Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Index** | The set of parameters (scope, locus, resolution, measurement, sameness rules) determining what an organism can register and respond to. Not a choice but the organism's mode of being. |
| **Differentiation** | Organism's graded, context-sensitive response to environmental structure, mediated by its index. A one-body phenomenon. |
| **Distinction** | Transmissible, reusable, contestable symbolic form. Constitutively dyadic. |
| **Shared pressure** | Two systems oriented to the same environmental/social demand (not experiencing it identically). |
| **Alignment** | Capacity to use another system's observable differentiation as guide to one's own orientation. Middle ground between redundancy and unintelligibility. |
| **Normative friction** | External standard enabling evaluation of performance as correct/incorrect, provided by the second body. |
| **Diagnostic signatures** | Third-party portability, repair dynamics, context-stability, correctness independent of payoff, code plasticity. |
| **Culturally maintained signal** | Socially transmitted, context-stable signal with fixed semantics (e.g., calibrated waggle dance). |
| **Proto-distinction** | Socially learned mapping with repair dynamics but limited portability/plasticity (e.g., crow grudge, whale codas). |

### Objections Addressed

1. **Inner speech and solitary thought**: These operate on distinctions already constituted dyadically. Fire requires ignition; the two-body structure is about ignition, not ongoing operation.

2. **Robinson Crusoe case**: The solitary scientist carries the internalized "generalized other" (Mead). Crusoe is world-coupled (consequences feed back); LLMs are not.

3. **Nicaraguan Sign Language**: NSL confirms the hypothesis. Home sign emerges in family dyads (distinction). NSL grammar emerges through iterated multi-cohort interaction (community-level).

4. **Predictive processing/FEP**: Describes differentiation (modeling sensory input), not distinction (public symbolic form). Multi-agent active inference is a mathematical ally.

5. **Solitary animal innovation**: Innovation is differentiation. It becomes distinction only when transmitted (when another recognizes and incorporates it).

6. **LLMs generating novel content**: LLMs are "statistical artifacts of past dyadic interaction." Hallucination becomes distinction only when humans accept/contest it. RLHF lacks reciprocity (unidirectional correction).

7. **Triviality objection**: The claim is not definitional. Distinction is defined by a cluster of properties (context-independence, arbitrariness, normativity, contestability), not just transmissibility.

8. **Updating vs. contesting**: Solitary systems can update (revise predictions) but not contest (challenge whether the category itself is right). Contesting requires an alternative standard from a system with a different index.

9. **Physical resistance**: Physics has laws, not rules. The lock cannot disagree about what counts as a key. Physical resistance provides efficiency standards, not convention standards.

10. **Waggle dance counterexample**: The dance is iconic (diagrammatic), not arbitrary. It is canalized with fixed semantics, not contestable. Its two-body structure is evolutionary, not developmental.

### Undefended Assumptions

1. **The index is always finite**: "Always a partial orientation to an inexhaustible world." This finiteness assumption is asserted, not defended.

2. **Domains classified by social science are continuous and entangled**: The "continuum assumption" is stated as uncontroversial within scope but is not argued for systematically.

3. **Ontological priority of pressure**: Pressure is treated as primitive. Its origin is briefly noted (initially need, later desire) but not grounded further.

4. **World-coupling as criterion**: The distinction between Crusoe (world-coupled) and LLMs (not world-coupled) relies on a notion of "closed loop with consequences" that is stipulated rather than derived.

5. **The diagnostic signatures are the right cluster**: The five signatures are introduced as operational tests, but no argument establishes that exactly these five are necessary or sufficient.

6. **Multi-agent active inference convergence**: The paper treats multi-agent active inference as a "mathematical ally" but does not establish whether its formalizations capture the same phenomenon.

## Inference as Policy

### Central Thesis

**Inference is stabilization under policy, not rule-governed transition between beliefs**: Inference is the settlement that emerges when a policy (a cluster of folds organized coherently) is applied to a configuration of distinctions under pressure. Logic does not describe laws of thought; it characterizes properties of stable outcomes under specific policies. Different policies produce different remainder -- different inferential capacities and blindnesses.

### Key Claims

#### Core Structural Claims

1. **Inference dissolved as categorical concept**: "Inference" names the high-constraint end of a gradient that all distinction-making inhabits, not a separate kind of act.

2. **Policy = cluster of folds resolvable to fixed point**: A policy includes precedence structures (lex specialis, lex posterior) that resolve conflicts determinately. Index policies are just more folds at meta-level.

3. **Five-layer policy stratification**:
   - Layer 1: Index policy (what can be distinguished)
   - Layer 2: Consequence policy (what follows from what -- where "inference" traditionally lives)
   - Layer 3: Conflict-resolution policy (priority orderings)
   - Layer 4: Update policy (revision under remainder pressure)
   - Layer 5: Metabolic evaluation (when remainder triggers revision)

4. **Gradient of constraint**: Deduction = Layer 2 only (maximum constraint). Abduction = Layers 2+4 (high constraint with revision). Paradigm shift = all layers including index (low constraint).

5. **Different logics = different policies**: Classical, paraconsistent, intuitionistic, relevance, linear logics are different stances toward remainder, contradiction, resource-sensitivity.

6. **No remainder-free policy**: Every policy produces remainder (consequence of finite partition of infinite continuum). Choice among policies = choice about which remainder to tolerate.

#### Properties of Stabilization Operators

7. **Conservativity**: Output contains only what is warranted by policy applied to input. The operator does not fabricate.

8. **Distinction-preservation**: Operator must preserve the medium of distinction. Classical explosion (trivial fixed point) destroys the medium.

9. **Idempotence**: Applying operator twice = applying once. Stable configurations are genuine fixed points.

10. **Derived-contradiction elimination**: Ideal operators distinguish atomic contradictions (genuine) from derived contradictions (artifacts of redundant representation).

#### Modal Structure

11. **T-failure (Box-phi -> phi invalid)**: The gap between commitment and realization. When stabilization genuinely normalizes, the input state is not a fixed point. Reflexivity holds only at fixed points.

12. **Two modal operators**:
    - Box_P (settlement under policy): prospective, doxastic, T fails
    - Box (topological necessity): invariance under index deformation, T holds

13. **Stabilization is doxastic, not alethic**: What is stable under policy is not thereby true. Stability = coherence under policy, not correspondence.

14. **Resilience as truth-measure**: "Truth" = high resilience (survival under perturbation of policy and index). Gradient, not binary.

15. **Paranoid vs. healthy stabilization**: Both achieve Box_P. The difference is whether Box_P is accompanied by (approximating) Box -- whether settlement tracks topology.

#### Value/Rule Distinction

16. **Extending Woodward's interventionism**: Value-sensitivity = varying inputs under fixed policy (causal). Rule-sensitivity = varying policy under fixed inputs (non-causal/constitutive).

17. **Laws vs. rules**: Laws are not revisable by systems they govern. Rules are revisable, contestable, permit misuse. The symbolic operates under rules.

18. **Misuse criterion**: Correctness and success come apart in symbolic domain. You can speak correctly and fail, or incorrectly and succeed. Physical domain fuses them.

19. **Why multiple logics exist**: If inference were governed by laws (key fits or doesn't), there would be one logic. Multiple logics exist because inference is governed by revisable rules.

#### Inference Without Beliefs

20. **Demarcation criteria for inference**:
    - Endogenous revisability (can the constraint be wrong? challenged?)
    - Commitment/realization gap (T-failure: representing states distinct from current physical state)

21. **LLMs**: The model alone does not infer (no endogenous revisability). The *coupled system* (user, model, training pipeline, deployment context) infers.

### Formal Claims

1. **Fixed-point semantics**: Induced operator computes fixed point of policy cluster applied iteratively until configuration no longer changes.

2. **LP's four-valued semantics (T, F, B, N)**: Provides evaluative machinery for distinction-preservation.

3. **Determinacy condition**: Total precedence structure -> unique fixed point. Partial precedence -> multiple fixed points (bifurcation, underdetermination).

4. **T-failure on non-reflexive frames**: When successor states are fixed points and current state is not, Box-phi ^ not-phi is satisfiable.

5. **Mathematical truth as intra-structural resilience**: 2+2=4 is stable under every admissible derivation policy within Peano arithmetic. The choice of axiom system is a policy choice.

6. **Modus ponens as maximally resilient**: Validated by classical, paraconsistent, intuitionistic, relevance, linear logics. Maximal resilience produces phenomenology of necessity.

### Novel Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Cut** | Distinction's relation to the field it partitions (dog vs. not-dog applied to undifferentiated field). |
| **Fold** | Distinction's relation to other distinctions (inclusion). Mammal folds dog. |
| **Remainder** | What any distinction excludes. Persists as pressure. Specific to the index that produced it. |
| **Policy** | Cluster of folds resolvable to fixed point, with precedence structure. |
| **Stabilization** | Arrival at form; achievement of coherence under policy. Not discovery of pre-existing structure. |
| **Becoming** | State before stabilization. Pressure operative but not crystallized. Multiple configurations live. |
| **T-failure** | Invalidity of Box-phi -> phi. Formal signature of gap between commitment and realization. |
| **Box_P** | Settlement under policy (prospective, doxastic). |
| **Box** | Topological necessity (invariance under index deformation). |
| **Resilience** | Degree to which distinction survives perturbation of policy and index. |
| **Metabolic cycle** | fold -> remainder -> unfold -> refold. How living systems manage remainder. |
| **Value-sensitivity** | Varying inputs under fixed policy (causal profile). |
| **Rule-sensitivity** | Varying policy under fixed inputs (non-causal/constitutive profile). |
| **Endogenous revisability** | Whether system governed by constraint can also revise it. |

### Objections Addressed

1. **Logical relativism**: Not all policies are equal. Some fabricate, some explode, some fail idempotence. Evaluation is about properties and fit with pressure, not correspondence to policy-independent validity.

2. **Pragmatism critique**: Constitutive properties (conservativity, idempotence, distinction-preservation) are not themselves policy choices. They define what counts as inference.

3. **Psychologism**: Policies have determinate structural properties independent of any particular thinker.

4. **Conventionalism**: Policies are public, repeatable, revisable, carry normative force. You can be wrong about which policy to apply.

5. **Regress of policy choice**: Application is causal/automatic (Layer 2). Normativity lives in revisability (Layer 4). Regress terminates in pressure (Layer 5) -- the non-rule-governed base.

6. **Mathematical truth contingent?**: Mathematical truths are fixed points within a structure. The structure itself (axiom choice) is a policy choice. Intra-structural necessity, inter-structural contingency.

7. **"Crazy" but structurally sound policies**: The framework does not call these "not inference." It calls them inference with minimal resilience and maximal ecological fragility. Structural constraints determine what counts as inference; ecological evaluation determines what counts as *good* inference.

### Undefended Assumptions

1. **Pressure as primitive**: "Pressure is created by value -- what matters." Origin in need/desire is noted but not grounded.

2. **Finite index partitioning infinite continuum**: This is central to why remainder is inevitable, but the infinity of the field is assumed.

3. **Policies are in principle resolvable to fixed points**: This is a condition for well-defined operators, but whether all operative policies satisfy it is not examined.

4. **Topological necessity (Box) is coherent**: The paper distinguishes Box_P from Box but does not provide a full account of what "invariance under index deformation" means operationally.

5. **Peirce alignment**: The paper notes "alignments" and "divergences" with Peirce but does not defend treating Peirce's categories as genuine precursors vs. superficial resemblances.

6. **The five-layer stratification is exhaustive**: The layers are introduced functionally, but no argument establishes that exactly five layers capture all operative policy dimensions.

## Remainder Under Feedback

### Central Thesis

**Categorical instability in social science is structural, not epistemic**: Social categories that are embedded in institutional feedback loops produce remainder (borderline populations) that accumulates and exerts pressure for revision. This instability is predictable from the index and feedback structure, not a failure of definition or theory. Stabilization is an achievement of institutional design, not convergence on the "right" definition.

### Key Claims

#### Core Structural Claims

1. **Distinction = Representation**: Every distinction is a partial capture mediated by an index. The two concepts are the same act viewed differently.

2. **Remainder is structurally inevitable**: Every distinction partitions an infinite, entangled continuum with a finite index. There is always something that does not fit cleanly.

3. **Cut remainder vs. Fold remainder**: Cut remainder = field exceeds distinction (Census form produces "Some Other Race"). Fold remainder = represented exceeds representation (abstraction).

4. **Constraint produces fit**: Hold a distinction in place long enough (through institutions) and the world reshapes around it. The category then appears to track real joints because it has *produced* them.

5. **Sedimentation**: Conflation of success (the category works) with truth (the category tracks real joints). Institutional success gets mistaken for truth.

6. **De-naturalization**: Recognizing that fit was produced by constraint, not found in the field.

7. **Recursion of distinction arrested by constraint**: Every distinction's index is itself a cluster of distinctions. The regress is arrested where institutional machinery (coding practices, workflow) makes stopping useful.

#### Remainder Dynamics

8. **Remainder persists as pressure**: It does not disappear because the distinction refuses it.

9. **Remainder is index-specific**: A different index produces a *new* distinction with *new* remainder, not revelation of hidden remainder.

10. **Updating vs. Contesting**: Updating = revising predictions within framework. Contesting = challenging the framework itself. Different kinds of remainder pressure.

11. **DSM example**: Operational criteria immediately produce remainder (four symptoms instead of five, atypical duration, bereavement complications). Each revision redistributes rather than eliminates hard cases.

12. **Census example**: Ethnicity/race separation presupposes orthogonality. 49.9 million "Some Other Race" responses = remainder of this specific index policy.

13. **PIT count example**: Single-night visibility requirement systematically undercounts episodically or invisibly homeless. Funding tied to count creates perverse incentives.

#### Contradictions Without Collapse

14. **Cross-institutional mismatch is legitimate**: Same person can be "employed" (survey), "inactive" (administrative), "work-limited" (disability). These are different indices for different purposes, not confused classification.

15. **Contradictions are not real contradictions**: They are artifacts of different indices applied to the same field.

16. **Harmonization destroys information**: Forcing single status requires choosing whose index governs; every other institutional purpose loses its specific information.

17. **Platform work as permanent remainder**: "Employed" for tax, "contracted" for labor protections. California ABC Test (tighten index) vs. Prop 22 (institutionalize third category) = two strategies for managing structural mismatch.

#### Diagnostic Framework

18. **Stabilization conditions**: Low remainder, aligned institutional purposes, weak feedback, stable measurement infrastructure.

19. **Fragmentation conditions**: High remainder, divergent stakeholder operationalizations, strong feedback, categories embedded in resource allocation or identity formation.

20. **BMI example**: Stable in low-pressure contexts (most population), fragile in high-pressure contexts (military fitness, bariatric eligibility).

21. **Falsifiable prediction**: High remainder + strong feedback should produce categorical instability. Clear counterexample would be a problem.

22. **Remainder audit**: Beyond reliability and validity, ask: What remainder will this cut create? How will it respond to feedback? Which institutional interfaces convert remainder into revision pressure? Is remainder tolerable or does it require governance?

### Formal Claims

1. **Remainder audit differs from sensitivity analysis and bias auditing**: Sensitivity asks if outcomes change under parameter tweaks (robustness). Bias auditing asks if outcomes differ systematically across groups (fairness). Remainder audit asks what population is produced at the boundary and what institutional pressures it will generate.

2. **Constraint and Power distinguished**: Power = constraint wielded by agent for asymmetric benefit. Constraint = the genus (includes language, infrastructure, convention -- not necessarily wielded).

3. **Speed of fit-production**: Governed by how much pressure the constraint channels. Census (identity-pressure, survival-pressure) produces fit fast; trade route borders produce fit slowly.

### Novel Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Fit** | Persistence through alignment with structure of what distinction meets. No agent required. |
| **Constraint** | Persistence through apparatus of symbolic world holding partition in place. Pure contingency. |
| **Power** | Constraint wielded by agent for asymmetric benefit. A species of constraint. |
| **Sedimentation** | Process by which contingent constraint produces structure it appears to have discovered. |
| **De-naturalization** | Recognizing fit was produced by constraint. |
| **Cut remainder** | Field exceeds distinction (too much to capture). |
| **Fold remainder** | Represented exceeds representation (abstraction loses specificity). |
| **Remainder audit** | Routine assessment of where boundary cases accumulate and how institutional interfaces convert to revision pressure. |
| **Updating** | Revising within framework. |
| **Contesting** | Challenging the framework itself. |

### Objections Addressed

1. **Just measurement error**: Measurement error implies deviation from true value. Remainder implies no such value exists -- produced by act of distinction.

2. **Just operationalization choices**: Index is not a choice among options but structural limit of the medium. You can operationalize differently but cannot avoid having an index.

3. **How this differs from Hacking's looping effects**: Hacking focuses on malleability of the subject. This framework focuses on structural inevitability of remainder even if subjects were static.

4. **How this differs from Goodhart**: Goodhart focuses on degradation of metric. This framework focuses on structural production of remainder at every boundary.

5. **How this differs from Bowker & Star's residual**: Their residual is a *category* within a scheme (NEC bins). Remainder is a *structural feature* of distinction itself, produced at every boundary.

6. **How this differs from performativity (Callon, MacKenzie)**: Performativity = how economic models shape markets. Constraint produces fit = general mechanism of which performativity is special case.

### Undefended Assumptions

1. **Domains of social science are continuous and entangled**: Stated as uncontroversial within scope, but not defended systematically.

2. **No natural kinds in social-scientific domains**: "Nobody seriously argues that 'poverty,' 'employment,' or 'depression' are natural kinds with discrete boundaries" -- but this is asserted, not demonstrated.

3. **Institutional feedback always operates**: The conditions under which feedback loops exist vs. don't is not systematically mapped.

4. **The distinction/differentiation boundary from companion paper**: The paper says it "treats distinction as given" but relies on the two-body hypothesis for the distinction/differentiation demarcation.

5. **Remainder audit is practically implementable**: The paper proposes it as "routine companion to validity and reliability assessment" but does not demonstrate operationalization.

6. **Fit is coherent as distinct from constraint-produced-fit**: The paper distinguishes persistence by fit from persistence by constraint, but whether "pure" fit exists is not examined.

---

## Cross-Paper Tensions

### 1. Constitution vs. Operation Boundary

**Two-Body Problem** claims the two-body structure is "constitutive at emergence, not at ongoing operation." Once constituted, distinctions can be operated on solo.

**Inference as Policy** expands inference to non-social systems (perceptual systems, motor planning, thermostats, LLM-coupled systems). It demarcates inference by endogenous revisability and T-failure, not by dyadic constitution.

**Tension**: If distinction is constitutively dyadic, how can a perceptual system (one-body) "infer" on distinctions? The papers seem to locate the two-body requirement at different levels:
- Two-Body: Distinction *itself* requires two bodies.
- Inference as Policy: Inference on already-constituted distinctions can be one-body.

But Inference as Policy also talks about stabilization in systems that never had dyadic constitution (motor systems, simple thermostats). Are these systems operating on differentiations (one-body) or distinctions (two-body)? The papers do not reconcile this directly.

### 2. Remainder Audit and Dyadic Constitution

**Remainder Under Feedback** proposes the remainder audit as a tool for evaluating social-scientific categories.

**Two-Body Problem** claims remainder is generated "at every level of the recursion" of distinction.

**Tension**: If remainder is ubiquitous and structural, what makes the remainder audit specifically useful for *social-scientific* categories vs. any distinctions? The answer seems to be feedback intensity (high in social categories), but this is not explicitly connected to the two-body constitution that makes these categories *distinctions* in the first place.

### 3. The Gradient and the Binary

**Two-Body Problem** presents a gradient (signal -> proto-distinction -> distinction) but emphasizes a constitutive binary: solitary systems *cannot* generate distinction.

**Inference as Policy** dissolves inference/distinction-making binary into a gradient of constraint.

**Tension**: Two-Body emphasizes a categorical difference (differentiation vs. distinction). Inference as Policy emphasizes continuity (gradient of constraint). The law/rule spectrum in Inference as Policy attempts to bridge this ("rules inherit normative character from dyadic constitution"), but there remains a question: is the two-body threshold categorical or itself a gradient?

### 4. Index Definition

**Two-Body Problem** defines index as "the organism's pre-reflective orientation" with components: scope, locus, resolution, measurement, sameness rules.

**Inference as Policy** adds "the index is not a choice from a menu; it *is* the system's mode of being" but also treats index as Layer 1 of policy (revisable under update pressure).

**Tension**: Is the index pre-reflective and non-chosen (Two-Body) or a revisable policy layer (Inference)? The answer seems to be "both, at different timescales" -- index is given at the moment of distinction but revisable under sufficient remainder pressure. But this creates ambiguity about what counts as "changing the index" vs. "making a new distinction."

### 5. Pressure as Primitive

All three papers treat **pressure** as primitive and the origin of value/remainder dynamics.

**Two-Body** grounds it in biological need (initially) and desire (later, once symbolic order exists).

**Inference as Policy** grounds it in Layer 5 (metabolic evaluation) and "the field's causal structure."

**Remainder Under Feedback** treats it as what "the constraint channels."

**Tension**: Pressure is central but underdeveloped. Is pressure pre-symbolic (biological need) or does it include symbolic pressures (desire, institutional demand)? If the latter, how does pressure avoid circularity (pressure -> distinction -> new symbolic pressures -> ...)?

### 6. LLM Assessment

**Two-Body Problem** argues LLMs lack triangulation (no index, no world-coupling, no stakes in coherent engagement). They are "statistical artifacts of past dyadic interaction."

**Inference as Policy** argues LLMs alone do not infer (no endogenous revisability) but the *coupled system* (user + model + pipeline) does infer.

**Tension**: Two-Body is more categorical (LLMs lack the structural conditions for distinction). Inference as Policy is more permissive (the coupled system infers). This creates a question: can a coupled human-LLM system *constitute new distinctions*, or only *operate on* already-constituted ones?

### 7. Truth

**Inference as Policy** dissolves truth into resilience: "distinctions that survive perturbation of policy and index."

**Two-Body Problem** distinguishes "success" (biological constraint) from "truth" (social norm requiring shared agreement).

**Tension**: Is truth a gradient of resilience (Inference) or a normative dimension requiring the second body (Two-Body)? The papers use "truth" differently: Inference uses it for high resilience, Two-Body uses it for a specific normative axis that requires dyadic constitution.

### 8. Topological Necessity (Box) vs. Dyadic Constitution

**Inference as Policy** introduces Box (topological necessity) as invariance under index deformation -- "features of the field that any reasonable index would approximate."

**Two-Body Problem** does not use this vocabulary but does distinguish fit (tracking invariant structure) from constraint (holding partition in place).

**Tension**: Is topological necessity something the field *has* independently of distinction-makers (suggesting realism about field structure)? If so, this sits uneasily with the constructivist emphasis in Two-Body (distinction constituted in dyadic interaction, not discovered). The papers may need to clarify whether the field has structure prior to distinction or whether "topological necessity" is itself a high-resilience achievement of distinction-making.
