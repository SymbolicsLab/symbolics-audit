## Document: 01_Ontology

### Core Concepts

1. **Pressure** — The true primitive of the theory. Created by value (what matters). Initially from need (organism's non-negotiable requirements for persistence), later from desire (can attach to anything). Pressure operates through index and crystallizes into distinction.

2. **Index** — The organism's pre-reflective orientation to the world; the condition under which distinguishing can occur. Not something added to distinction but prior to it.
   - Components: scope (domain), locus (location), resolution (grain), measurement (how membership determined), rules for sameness (when two instances are "the same")

3. **Medium** — A type of index. Photography, language, paint, music, mathematical notation are all index policies determining what can be represented and what falls into remainder.

4. **Abstraction** — Not a separate concept but how much remainder a distinction produces; how much the index policy excludes.

5. **Implicit vs Explicit Index** — Pre-symbolic: implicit (operative but not articulable). Symbolic: explicit (shareable, contestable, refinable). The shift enables the symbolic order.

6. **Distinction** — Pressure crystallized into transmissible form. Both epistemic and ontological. The unit of symbolic operation. Transmissible = can be communicated, contested, applied elsewhere.

7. **Representation** — The same phenomenon as distinction from a different angle. Distinction emphasizes partitioning; representation emphasizes partiality. Every partition is partial; every partial capture partitions.

8. **Remainder** — The gap between the representation and what it represents = the gap between the distinction and the continuum it partitions. Unifies distinction and representation.

9. **Recursion of Distinction** — Distinction is inherently recursive. Each distinction requires an index, each index parameter is a distinction with its own index. Mise en abyme, all the way down. Never converges (world is infinite, entangled continuum).

10. **Stabilization** — Where recursion is arrested. Not because you've reached bottom, but because pressure is managed at this level.

11. **Destabilization (Unfold)** — When arrested recursion reopens. Boundary cases force deeper examination.

12. **The Two-Body Hypothesis** — Distinction emerges from two systems under shared pressure where one's differentiation becomes legible to the other. The first distinction isn't made; it's recognized.
    - Requirements: shared pressure, observability, alignment
    - Explains why distinction is social at origin

13. **Updating** — One-body phenomenon. Revising predictions when evidence conflicts (prediction error minimization).

14. **Contesting** — Two-body phenomenon. Challenging whether the category itself is right. Requires alternative standard from different index.

15. **Success** — Pragmatic measure. Does the distinction work for the organism? One-body axis.

16. **Fit** — Structural measure. Does the distinction track features invariant under perturbation? Pre-symbolic (bacterium has fit but not truth).

17. **Truth** — The symbolic world's name for high fit. A meta-distinction about which distinctions track structure. Not categorical but a gradient (resilience gradient).

18. **Resilience Gradient** — From zero resilience (collapses under any perturbation) to maximal resilience (survives perturbation of both policy and index).

19. **Constitution vs Operation** — Two-body condition governs constitution (how distinctions come into being). Operation on existing distinctions can be solitary.

20. **Differentiation vs Distinction** — Solitary work produces differentiation (form of distinction but not status). Distinction achieved through dyadic uptake.

21. **The Field** — What distinctions partition. Infinite, entangled continuum. Has topology (ridges, joints, gradients, features). Some structure is invariant.

22. **Physical vs Constituted Structure** — Physical field has pre-given topology. Symbolic world has constituted topology (structure emerging from establishing distinctions). Both support fit.

23. **Contradiction** — Not a logical primitive but an index policy outcome. Requires holding two mutually exclusive sides of the same distinction with aligned index parameters.

### Structural Claims

1. **Primitivity hierarchy**: Pressure > Index > Distinction. Pressure is truly primitive; distinction is primitive only within the symbolic order.

2. **Two-body structure**: Solitary systems can only update; dyadic systems can contest. This is a categorical distinction.

3. **Success/Fit/Truth gradient**: Not a trichotomy but a continuous gradient organized by resilience (perturbation-survival).

4. **Constitution/Operation split**: Constitution requires two bodies; operation can be solitary but operates on dyadically-constituted distinctions.

5. **Five moves from distinction to self**: Distinction -> form/formula -> inference -> modality -> self. All through folding.

6. **Index always prior**: Index is the condition of possibility; distinction is what becomes possible when indices coordinate.

### Relations Between Concepts

- Pressure creates distinction through crystallization
- Index mediates pressure's operation
- Medium is a type of index
- Abstraction is remainder-production by an index
- Distinction = representation (same phenomenon, different emphasis)
- Remainder unifies distinction and representation
- Recursion of distinction generates remainder at every level
- Stabilization arrests recursion; destabilization reopens it
- Two-body condition → distinction emerges; one-body → only differentiation
- Updating ⊂ one-body; Contesting ⊂ two-body
- Success < Fit < Truth (gradient, not categories)
- Resilience operationalizes fit/truth
- Constitution (two-body) enables Operation (can be one-body)
- Field has topology → fit possible; fit → truth (with symbolic apparatus)

### Open Questions

1. What is the minimal structure of pressure? Is it just "directed differentiation"? (Connection to FEP precision-weighting)
2. How do index policies compose? What governs interaction between distinction A's index and distinction B's index?
3. Is there a minimal index? What's the simplest index that allows distinction to persist?
4. In two-body emergence, what determines which organism's differentiation becomes "signal" vs "receiver"? Symmetric or asymmetric?
5. How does two-body hypothesis scale? Does N-body coordination produce qualitatively different kinds of distinction? (Partially answered: dyads produce distinction, communities produce grammar)
6. Resilience gradient dissolves "truth" as categorical concept. Implications for correspondence, coherence, pragmatist theories?
7. How does physical topology / constituted topology relationship cash out formally? Category-theoretic treatment?

## Document: 02_Operations

### Core Concepts

1. **Cut** — A distinction's relation to the field it partitions. Produces bipolar form (phi / not-phi). A representation of the field mediated by index. Always partial (finite form meeting infinite structure).

2. **Fold** — A distinction's relation to other distinctions (inclusion). "Mammal folds dog." Inclusion implies exclusion. Creates position from which distinction-as-such is available.

3. **Cut and Fold as Relations** — Not operations but two aspects of every distinction. No pure cut (every distinction already includes others in its structure via index parameters).

4. **Policy** — A cluster of folds organized coherently. Not a separate kind of thing.

5. **Stabilization** — When a policy cluster achieves coherence under pressure. An achievement, not a given. Often requires social transmissibility.

6. **Opacity** — Gradient of access to the index of the distinction that cut produces. Not intrinsic to cut-event but relational.

7. **Hierarchy built by fold**: distinctions -> form/formulas -> inference -> modality -> self (five moves)

8. **Index policies as folds** — Scope, locus, resolution, measurement, sameness rules are meta-level folds (distinctions about distinctions).

9. **Induced Operators** — When a policy cluster is applied to input, it induces an operator (stabilization function). Input -> what is stable under this cluster.

10. **Conservativity** — Property: output contains only distinctions from input (no fabrication).

11. **Monotonicity** — Property: more input -> more (or equal) output.

12. **Idempotence** — Property: applying policy twice = applying once.

13. **Distinction-preservation** — Constitutive property: policy must preserve the capacity to discriminate. Classical explosion violates this.

14. **LP (Logic of Paradox)** — Builds contradiction-tolerance into consequence layer.

15. **Classical + AGM** — Builds contradiction-elimination into update layer.

16. **Policy Stratification (Five Layers)**:
    - Layer 1: Index policy (defines representational space)
    - Layer 2: Consequence policy (what follows from what)
    - Layer 3: Conflict-resolution policy (when consequence folds disagree)
    - Layer 4: Update policy (governs unfold phase, revision)
    - Layer 5: Metabolic evaluation (how remainder registered as pressure)

17. **Presupposition ordering** — Each layer presupposes those below it.

18. **Dynamic entanglement** — Each layer can put pressure on every other through metabolic cycle.

19. **Independent interveneability** — Can vary one layer while holding others fixed.

20. **Ontological homogeneity** — All five layers are folds, all are distinctions.

21. **Gradient of constraint** — What we call "inference" is high-constraint end (Layer 2 only). "Creative work" is low-constraint (multiple layers varied).

22. **Laws vs Rules** — Physics has laws (correctness and success fused). Symbolic has rules (can be broken, followed, challenged, revised).

23. **Separation of correctness from success** — Hallmark of the symbolic.

24. **Law/Rule = Fit/Constraint Gradient** — Same spectrum from different angles. Law = mechanism of fit enforcement; Rule = mechanism of constraint imposition.

25. **Realization** (temperature/mean kinetic energy) — Fold with correspondence policy.

26. **Constitution** (clay/statue) — "Statue" as policy index on clay-arrangements.

27. **Definitional identity** (water/H2O) — Fold with correspondence policy.

28. **Constraint** (conservation laws) — Higher-level index policy clusters governing admissible folds.

### Structural Claims

1. **Cut and Fold are perspectives** on the same act, not two types of distinction.

2. **Five-layer policy stratification** with presupposition ordering AND dynamic entanglement.

3. **Gradient from law to rule** organized by endogenous revisability:
   - Pure law -> Law with flexibility -> Biological constraint -> Operant -> Proto-rule -> Full rule

4. **Two-body condition enters at distinction level** — Below that, fold-like behavior without normative character from dyadic constitution.

5. **Bidirectional entanglement** — Constraint -> fit (naturalization); Fit -> constraint (codification/tradition).

6. **Ontological homogeneity across stratification** — All layers are folds/distinctions.

### Relations Between Concepts

- Cut relates distinction to field; Fold relates distinction to distinctions
- Every cut is also a fold (of index parameters)
- Policy = cluster of folds
- Stabilization = policy cluster achieving coherence under pressure
- Induced operator = what happens when policy applied to configuration
- All distinction-making operates under policy
- Different logics = different Layer 2 policies
- Layers 1-5 have presupposition ordering but dynamic entanglement
- Laws : fit :: Rules : constraint
- Law and rule are same gradient as fit and constraint
- Constraint -> fit via naturalization/opacity
- Fit -> constraint via preservation/codification

### Open Questions

1. What is the minimal fold? Can fold operate on a single distinction, or inherently requires at least two?
2. How do policy clusters interact? When two clusters make incompatible claims? (Partially answered: Layer 3 handles within a stack. Between stacks?)
3. Is there a limit to the hierarchy? What's above "self"?
4. Policy stratification has five layers. Is this the right number? Could Layer 3 be absorbed into Layer 2? Could Layer 5 be split?
5. How does stratification relate to Peirce's Firstness/Secondness/Thirdness?
6. The gradient of constraint dissolves "inference" as a category. Implications for epistemology? Philosophy of logic?

## Document: 03_Phenomenology

### Core Concepts

1. **Remainder** — What any distinction excludes. Field is infinite entangled continuum; any distinction is finite form. Remainder is the excess. Not waste but persists as pressure.

2. **Remainder in social systems** — Becomes strategic under reflexive conditions (measured population can observe and respond). Accumulates at category boundaries. Feedback loop: remainder -> strategic response -> revision pressure -> category change -> new remainder.

3. **Organized remainder** — Remainder that has found its voice; a counter-framework in formation. Remainder that has found its second body.

4. **Unfold** — Remainder pressing back on a fold. When constraint loosens, remainder reconfigures the system.

5. **Unfold vs field pressure** — Unfold is about folds (inclusion relations). Field delivering consequences on mispartitioned cuts is just causality, not unfold.

6. **Metabolic cycle** — Fold -> Remainder -> Unfold -> (new) Fold -> (new) Remainder...

7. **Crystallization** — Death by closure. Fold so rigid unfold never happens. No remainder -> no next cycle.

8. **Dissolution** — Unfold so total no fold holds. Opposite pathology.

9. **Incremental unfold (metabolism)** — When apparatus has mechanisms for absorbing remainder (revision cycles, boundary committees).

10. **Catastrophic unfold (rupture)** — When apparatus is rigid and remainder accumulates without outlet. Whole structure gives way at once.

11. **Threshold for rupture** — Remainder becomes organized; develops its own index; counter-framework emerges.

12. **Two axes**: Apparatus flexibility + Remainder organization. High flexibility + low organization = incremental. Low flexibility + high organization = rupture.

13. **Shimmer (dual aspect)**:
    - At moment of fold: oscillation between folded and unfolded states. Both readings live.
    - As trace of remainder: ongoing felt sense that something was left out.

14. **Shimmer and generativity** — Artists/theorists attend to shimmer. Stay in oscillation. New distinctions become possible at shimmer.

15. **Shimmer and commitment/realization gap** — Phenomenology of prospective necessity. Policy commits you to something not yet realized.

16. **Opacity** — Relational gradient of access to the index of a distinction. Same distinction can be opaque to one, transparent to another.

17. **Asymmetric opacity by design** — Imposed distinctions: those who impose retain index access; those living under them do not.

18. **The Metabolism (full cycle)**:
    1. Pressure (from value) operates through index
    2. Pressure crystallizes into distinction
    3. Cut partitions field; Fold includes distinctions
    4. Fold generates remainder
    5. Remainder persists as pressure -> unfold
    6. New folding possible -> cycle continues

### Structural Claims

1. **Remainder persists as pressure** — Not eliminated by the distinction refusing it.

2. **Social remainder is reflexive** — Measured population responds to measurement.

3. **Unfold operates only on folds** — Field pressure on cuts is causality, not unfold.

4. **Living system = continuing metabolic cycle**. Dead system = crystallization OR dissolution.

5. **Incremental vs catastrophic unfold** — Gradient on two axes: apparatus flexibility and remainder organization.

6. **Shimmer present throughout** — At fold (oscillation) and after (trace).

7. **Opacity determines who sees the index** — Access to policy machinery.

### Relations Between Concepts

- Remainder is what fold excludes
- Unfold is remainder pressing back
- Metabolism = fold-remainder-unfold cycle
- Crystallization = rigid fold, no unfold
- Dissolution = no stable fold
- Shimmer = oscillation at fold + trace of remainder
- Shimmer heightened when opacity high
- Opacity = gradient of index access
- Organized remainder = counter-framework = remainder that found its second body
- Incremental unfold linked to Layer 4 (update policy) being operative
- Catastrophic unfold = Layer 4 blocked + organized remainder

### Open Questions

1. Is shimmer always present, or only under certain conditions?
2. Can remainder accumulate indefinitely, or is there a threshold before rupture?
3. What determines incremental vs catastrophic unfold? (Partially answered: rigidity relative to remainder accumulation; Layer 4 operative or not)
4. How does opacity interact with unfold? Does high opacity make unfold harder or easier?
5. The commitment/realization gap connects to T-failure. Is there a phenomenology of the other direction — actuality without settlement (contingent holding that feels precarious)?

## Document: 04_Ecology

### Core Concepts

1. **Spencer-Brown Critique** — "Draw a distinction" presupposes agent, instrument, surface already differentiated. Spencer-Brown starts from a position of power. Drawing is an act of power.

2. **Endogenous Distinctions** — Discovered in the world. Persist by fit. Mode: becoming. Pressure finds joints and crystallizes around them. Examples: solid/liquid, predator/prey, edible/poisonous.

3. **Exogenous Distinctions** — Held in place by apparatus of symbolic world. Persist by constraint. Mode: drawing. Index is stipulated. Examples: legal/illegal, citizen/non-citizen, poor/not-poor.

4. **Constraint without agent** — Not all constraint has an agent. Much of apparatus is pure contingency (grammar, infrastructure). Power is the special case: constraint wielded for asymmetric benefit.

5. **Naturalization** — Constraint produces fit. World rearranges around constraints until they look endogenous. The contingent comes to feel necessary.

6. **Naturalization as modal shift** — Box_P appearing as Box. Settlement under policy appearing as topological necessity.

7. **Mechanisms of naturalization**:
   - Sedimentation (temporal): time buries the index
   - Complexity: apparatus too intricate to see through
   - Power asymmetry: imposers retain access, subjects do not
   - Simple non-disclosure: no one tells you
   - Speed: constraint produces fit faster than index can be tracked

8. **De-naturalization** — Recognizing Box as Box_P. Recognizing that apparent joints are artifacts of apparatus. Showing world could have arranged differently.

9. **Fit -> Constraint (reverse direction)** — Regularity that works gets preserved, repeated, transmitted, enforced. Preservation mechanism adds constraint on top of original fit. Generates its own remainder (codification loses resolution).

10. **Box (topological necessity)** — phi invariant under deformation of index. Field has structure any reasonable index would approximate. Maps to endogenous source. Persistence by fit. Governed by laws.

11. **Box_P (settlement under policy)** — phi holds at fixed point current policy produces. Prospective. Maps to exogenous source. Persistence by constraint. Governed by rules.

12. **T-failure patterns**:
    - Endogenous: Box phi AND NOT phi (committed but not yet realized)
    - Exogenous: phi AND NOT Box_P phi (actual but not settled)

13. **Divergence cases**:
    - Box_P phi without Box phi: paranoid system (stable under policy, tracks nothing)
    - Box phi without Box_P phi: genuine inquiry (field has structure policy can't capture yet)

14. **Resilience** — Operationalizes Box/Box_P distinction. How much perturbation does distinction survive?

15. **Emergence vs Persistence** — Two-Body hypothesis answers how distinction emerges. Ecology answers how distinction persists (fit or constraint).

16. **Early developmental distinctions** — Persist by fit (track real affective states).

17. **Institutional categories** — Persist by constraint (held by apparatus).

18. **Sedimented distinctions** — Appear endogenous but are exogenous. Hardest to metabolize. Require de-naturalization first.

19. **Where theory meets politics**:
    - Who gets to draw? (Power = constraint for asymmetric benefit)
    - How do constrained distinctions become "natural"? (Constraint produces fit = ideology)
    - What does de-naturalization require? (Reveal contingency behind apparent necessity)
    - When is unfold possible? (Apparatus loosens via remainder accumulation, drift, contestation)

### Structural Claims

1. **Two sources of distinction**: endogenous (becoming, fit) vs exogenous (drawing, constraint).

2. **Fit/Constraint bidirectional**: Constraint produces fit (naturalization). Fit becomes constraint (codification).

3. **Two modalities needed**: Box (topological necessity) and Box_P (settlement under policy).

4. **Fit/constraint = law/rule gradient** (same spectrum, different angles).

5. **Naturalization involves opacity**: mechanism that matters is opacity of index, not specific pathway.

6. **Modal table organizes sources**: endogenous/Box/fit/law vs exogenous/Box_P/constraint/rule.

7. **Emergence (two-body) then persistence (fit or constraint)**: Different questions about same phenomenon.

### Relations Between Concepts

- Endogenous : Fit :: Exogenous : Constraint
- Endogenous : Box :: Exogenous : Box_P
- Endogenous : Becoming :: Exogenous : Drawing
- Endogenous : Laws :: Exogenous : Rules
- Naturalization = Constraint -> Fit = Box_P -> Box (appearing)
- De-naturalization = recognizing Box as Box_P
- Opacity enables naturalization
- Resilience operationalizes Box/Box_P
- Two-body answers emergence; Ecology answers persistence
- Sedimented = exogenous appearing endogenous
- Power = constraint wielded for asymmetric benefit

### Open Questions

1. Is endogenous/exogenous distinction itself a distinction? (Self-reference)
2. How identify constrained vs discovered when constraint has produced fit? (Partially answered: test resilience via perturbation)
3. Role of time? Is dynamic the same regardless of speed? (Answered: time is one mechanism of naturalization, what matters is opacity of index)
4. Can distinction be both endogenous AND exogenous? (Probably yes: tracks real structure AND held by apparatus)
5. When does constraint without agent become constraint with one? (Apparatus acquires beneficiaries who maintain it)
6. Is there a threshold beyond which de-naturalization becomes practically impossible? (Structurally always possible, practically may require unavailable resources)
7. The paranoid system is Box_P without Box. Is there a name for opposite pathology (only sees Box, treats all Box_P as illegitimate)? (Naive realism? Scientism?)
8. How does resilience interact with the two modalities?

## Document: 05_Formalism

### Core Concepts

1. **Core principle of formalization** — Agda proves what we ask it to prove if internally coherent. Coherence is not correctness. Real question: does formalization capture what theory means?

2. **Current architecture table**:
   - Pressure: primitive from value
   - Index: organism's orientation
   - Distinction: crystallized pressure in transmissible form
   - Cut: distinction's relation to field
   - Fold: distinction's relation to other distinctions
   - Policy: cluster of folds with five-layer stratification
   - Stabilization: coherence under pressure
   - Remainder: what fold excludes
   - Unfold: remainder pressing back
   - Shimmer: oscillation at fold + trace
   - Opacity: gradient of access to index
   - Resilience: degree distinction survives perturbation
   - Box: topological necessity, invariance under index deformation
   - Box_P: settlement, fixed point under current policy

3. **FDE World-Indexed Fold model**:
   - World = Natural numbers
   - Atom at world w = Fin w
   - Config = pairs of lists (positive and negative literals)
   - FOUR = four FDE truth values (Neither, False, True, Both)

4. **Proven properties**:
   - Conservativity: support(fold phi) subset support phi
   - Contradiction-preservation: +a, -a in phi implies +a, -a in fold phi

5. **Stated but not proven**: Idempotence (requires bucket stability lemmas)

6. **What model captures**: fold as stabilization operator, conservative (no fabrication), paraconsistent (contradictions persist)

7. **What model does NOT capture**: fold as inclusion, cut/fold co-constitution, remainder/unfold/shimmer, opacity as gradient, index policy fully, endogenous/exogenous sources, pressure as primitive

8. **Policy-cluster interpretation** — Resolves tension between "fold is relation" (theory) and "fold is operator" (Agda). Agda formalizes what policy clusters DO (induced operators), not fold-as-relation.

9. **Reinterpreting proofs**:
   - Conservativity: policy can't introduce distinctions it didn't receive
   - Contradiction-preservation: policy can't eliminate contradictions by fiat
   - Gap theorem: different policies produce structurally different outputs
   - T-failure: consistency operator is doxastic, not alethic
   - Non-explosion: LP is paraconsistent

10. **All distinction-making operates under policy** — Key unifying insight. "Inference" is high-constraint end of gradient.

11. **Different logics = different Layer 2 policies**: Classical (explode), LP (preserve/localize contradiction), FDE (four-valued), LFI (consistency operator tracks "safe" contradictions)

12. **Gradient of constraint formalized**: Deduction = Layer 2 only. Abduction = Layers 2 + 4. Paradigm shift = all layers.

13. **Gap between theory and formalization** — Formalization starts after the interesting part. Takes atoms as given. Theory is about how distinctions come to be.

14. **Two modalities formalization status**:
    - Box (topological necessity): not directly represented. Would need two accessibility relations.
    - Box_P (settlement): closer to what current Agda captures. T-failure proven.
    - Interaction and naturalization not formalized.

15. **Resilience formalization possibility**: Define perturbation space, resilience = measure of perturbations survived.

16. **Bridge Problem** — Core challenge: connecting rich conceptual vocabulary to verifiable formal structures.

17. **Spec Registry** — symbolics-audit/spec/registry.yaml tracks formal specs and relation to theory.

### Structural Claims

1. **Formalization captures induced operators, not fold-as-relation**.

2. **Theory has moved past where current Agda work can serve**.

3. **Two paths forward**:
   - Continue operator work (prove more policy properties)
   - Formalize fold-as-relation (likely requires category theory: objects = distinctions, morphisms = inclusions, fold/unfold as adjoint functors)

4. **Formalization is modeling, not capturing** — A model illuminates structural properties without claiming to be the thing.

5. **Most theoretical concepts are currently theory-only**.

### Relations Between Concepts

- Policy cluster -> induced operator (when applied to configuration)
- Different logics = different Layer 2 policies
- Gradient of constraint = number of layers varied
- Box : T validated :: Box_P : T fails
- Resilience potentially operationalizes Box/Box_P formally
- Conservativity proves no fabrication by policy
- Contradiction-preservation proves paraconsistent behavior

### Open Questions

1. What would it mean to formalize "pressure"? Is it formalizable?
2. Can fold-as-inclusion be represented in Agda? What would distinctions be?
3. Is there a formal dual to stabilization corresponding to unfold?
4. Should formalization wait until theory settles, or can formalization help theory settle?
5. How should two modalities (Box and Box_P) be formalized? Two accessibility relations? Different frame conditions?
6. Can resilience be given a formal measure?
7. Five-layer stratification has formal structure. Right formalism? Dependent types? Effect systems?
8. Gradient of constraint (layers varied) is central. Can this be formalized as parameter space?
9. Naturalization (Box_P appearing as Box) involves opacity of index. Formal treatment of "opacity"?

## Tensions/Inconsistencies

### 1. Terminology: "Unfold" Ambiguity
- **01_Ontology** uses "destabilization" parenthetically equated with "unfold" when discussing recursion reopening
- **03_Phenomenology** defines unfold specifically as "remainder pressing back on a fold" — applies only to folds, not cuts
- **Minor tension**: destabilization (which could apply to cuts) vs unfold (specifically about folds)

### 2. Where Does Pressure Live in the Formal Architecture?
- **01_Ontology**: Pressure is the true primitive, prior to index and distinction
- **05_Formalism**: Lists pressure as primitive in the architecture table, but notes "not represented" in formalization
- **Tension**: If pressure is truly primitive, how can the theory function formally without it? Is pressure formalizable, or is it necessarily theory-only?

### 3. Cut and Field vs Distinction and Remainder
- **02_Operations**: "When a cut mispartitions the field — the field delivers consequences. Not resistance, not pressure in the sense of remainder — just causality."
- **03_Phenomenology**: Distinguishes unfold (about folds) from field pressure (causality on cuts)
- **Potential tension**: If cut also produces remainder (as stated in 01_Ontology and 02_Operations), but field-resistance isn't remainder-as-pressure, what is remainder-from-cut? Is it just the gap between representation and represented, but not "pressing back"?

### 4. The Two-Body Requirement for Truth Assessment vs Solitary Resilience Testing
- **01_Ontology**: "You can't test whether your distinction tracks the structure or merely your idiosyncratic index without another index for comparison."
- **04_Ecology**: "Test resilience. Perturb the policy/index and see whether the distinction re-emerges"
- **Potential tension**: Can an individual test resilience through self-perturbation, or does genuine testing require a second body? The resilience test seems more solitary than the two-body condition for truth suggests.

### 5. Five Moves from Distinction to Self — Where Does This Sit?
- **02_Operations**: Lists the five moves (distinctions -> form/formula -> inference -> modality -> self) as "all folds"
- This structural claim appears only once and isn't developed elsewhere
- **Gap**: This hierarchy could be developed more systematically; currently isolated

### 6. Hierarchy Above "Self"?
- **02_Operations**: Open question: "Is there a limit to the hierarchy? What's above 'self'?"
- No document addresses what might be above self in the fold hierarchy
- **Open structural question** — not inconsistency but notable gap

### 7. Minimal Fold Problem
- **02_Operations**: "What is the minimal fold? Can a fold operate on a single distinction, or does it inherently require at least two?"
- If fold is inclusion (distinction A includes distinction B), it seems to require two by definition
- But index policies are "folds operating at a meta-level" — are these folds on single distinctions?
- **Conceptual tension** requiring clarification

### 8. Layer 3 Potentially Redundant?
- **02_Operations**: Open question suggests Layer 3 (conflict-resolution) might be absorbable into Layer 2 (consequence)
- Elsewhere the five layers are treated as settled architecture
- **Potential structural instability** in the stratification

### 9. Formalization Lagging Theory
- **05_Formalism**: "The theory has shifted significantly. The FDE-fold work was useful for exploring structural properties, but the theory has moved past where it can serve."
- The formalization captures none of: pressure, remainder, unfold, shimmer, opacity, the two modalities distinctly, resilience, gradient of constraint
- **Acknowledged gap** but raises question: is the theory outpacing any ability to verify/constrain it?

### 10. Index as Prior vs Index as Fold
- **01_Ontology**: "Index is prior to distinction" — index is the condition of possibility
- **02_Operations**: "Index policies (scope, locus, resolution, measurement, sameness rules) are just more folds operating at a meta-level: distinctions about distinctions"
- **Potential tension**: If index is prior to distinction (01), how can index components be folds (which are relations between distinctions) (02)?
- **Resolution implicit**: Index is prior TO distinction (the capacity to distinguish precedes the act), but the explicit articulation of index components uses distinctions (is itself symbolic operation on already-constituted concepts)

### 11. Ontological Homogeneity Claim
- **02_Operations**: "All five layers are folds. All are distinctions. There's no point where you step outside distinction into something categorically different."
- But **01_Ontology**: Pressure is "the true primitive" and "prior to both" index and distinction
- **Tension**: If everything in policy is distinction, but pressure is prior to distinction, then pressure is categorically different. The ontological homogeneity of the stratification doesn't extend to the primitive.

### 12. Naturalization Timescale
- **04_Ecology**: "The timescale of constraint producing fit varies with pressure, but the timescale is empirically contingent, not structurally interesting. What matters is index opacity."
- But several examples emphasize temporal sedimentation heavily (generations, centuries)
- **Minor tension**: Claims timescale isn't structurally interesting, but temporal depth features prominently in examples
