## Core Concepts (alphabetical)

- **Admissible states**: Fold-stable configurations; states where fold(Phi) = Phi; the fixed points that constitute genuine equilibria for a symbolic system.

- **Attention (as cut)**: The operator that transitions from undivided field (Level -1/0) to distinction (Level 1); attention as metabolic unfold that articulates flux into figure/ground.

- **Aufhebung vs. Fold**: Hegelian sublation (negating while preserving) vs. recursive fold (normalizing while preserving); fold contains contradiction rather than synthesizing it.

- **Becoming (of distinction)**: Distinctions do not get "drawn" by an agent; they *become* through committed orientation whose outcome is not known in advance. The most fundamental becoming is the becoming of a distinction itself.

- **Benchmark (as fold-stable attractor)**: In scientific/ML contexts, benchmarks function as stabilization operators around which fragmented communities coordinate; displacing them requires value-level intervention.

- **Commitment**: What holds at all stable completions of the current state (formally: Box-phi); distinct from realization (phi in s); commitment is closed under logical consequence.

- **Configuration**: A finite set of formulas Phi in Pfin(Form) representing an agent's symbolic commitments; the raw material of reasoning subject to normalization.

- **Conservativity**: atoms(fold(Phi)) subseteq atoms(Phi); folding introduces no new primitive content; what emerges was implicit in what entered.

- **Contained contradiction**: Contradictions that are localized, preserved, and prevented from exploding; the capacity to register conflict without being destroyed by it.

- **Contradiction-preservation**: If Phi contains both p and not-p for atomic p, both may persist in fold(Phi) without entailing arbitrary conclusions; paraconsistency as structural achievement.

- **Creative regime**: Delta-I(unfold) > Delta-I(fold); novelty accumulates, exploration dominates; risk of dissolution if unchecked.

- **Crystalline regime**: Delta-I(unfold) < Delta-I(fold); rigidity increases, stasis approaches; risk of death-by-order.

- **Crystallization**: Death by excessive fold; the system rigidifies into unchanging pattern, losing its dynamics; the metabolism stops when pressure vanishes.

- **Cut**: The primitive operation of distinction; produces phi / not-phi; Level 1 of the organizational hierarchy.

- **Depth**: How many times a distinction has been repositioned by broader cuts; not hidden layers but iterative scope-expansion.

- **Dissolution**: Death by excessive unfold; distinctions proliferate without stabilization, form disintegrates into incoherent flux.

- **Distinction**: The atomic primitive of the entire system; the invariant token from which all form, inference, modality, selfhood, and transformation are composed. Level 1 of the hierarchy.

- **Dual hierarchy**: The orthogonal organizational hierarchy (what is being stabilized) and locus hierarchy (what performs the stabilization).

- **Entangled concepts**: Concepts that are co-generated as two sides of one cut (inside/outside); distinguished from standalone concepts that operate as pre-distinction forces (pressure, value).

- **Epiphany cycle**: Pressure -> unfold -> fold -> remainder; the structured phenomenology of insight.

- **Explosion (ex contradictione quodlibet)**: The classical principle that any contradiction entails everything; what paraconsistency prevents.

- **F (transition function)**: Maps each admissible state to the set of admissible states reachable through licensed cognitive transitions; defines accessibility structure.

- **Filter (inverted/top-down constraint)**: Higher levels (especially S5, identity-as-theory) project constraints onto lower levels (attention); you cannot perceive what would destabilize your identity-theory.

- **Fixed point**: A fold-stable configuration; fold(Phi) = Phi; where no further processing is necessary.

- **Fold**: The operator that takes a finite set of formulas and returns its canonical, stabilized form. fold: Pfin(Form) -> Pfin(Form). Satisfies idempotence, conservativity, and contradiction-preservation.

- **Fold/unfold coupling**: The metabolic tick: step = fold compose unfold; generation followed by stabilization; neither alone yields viable dynamics.

- **Form**: Compositional representations; formulas and configurations; Level 2 of the organizational hierarchy.

- **Godelian pressure**: At Level 5, the identity-theory cannot prove its own consistency or soundness (RFN(S_t)); structural incompleteness that generates pressure for transformation.

- **Homeostatic regime**: Delta-I(unfold) approximately equals Delta-I(fold); dynamic equilibrium, living flow; the metastable condition of ongoing life.

- **Horizonality (Husserlian)**: Every present intention carries implicit co-intentions not yet thematically fulfilled; formalized as T-failure (Box-phi and not-phi).

- **Identity-as-Theory (Level 5)**: A self-referential theory S_t capable of encoding its own structure; subject to Godelian pressure.

- **Idempotence**: fold(fold(Phi)) = fold(Phi); folding twice yields the same result as folding once; captures reflective equilibrium.

- **Inference (Level 3)**: Fold-stable configurations with consequence relations; the organizational level where modal classification emerges.

- **Interlinked concepts**: Pairs like inside/outside that are mutually entailed positions produced by a single cut; neither exists independently.

- **Interpretive paternalism**: Having one's gap (Box-phi and not-phi) closed for one by an external agent; the deepest form of paternalism.

- **Interval of becoming**: The space between Box-phi and phi not holding trivially; where time, learning, agency, and meaning emerge; the formal signature of becoming.

- **K axiom**: Box(phi -> psi) -> (Box-phi -> Box-psi); the distribution axiom; valid in the framework.

- **Locus hierarchy**: What performs the stabilization; Levels 0-3 from inanimate (external forces) to human/recursive (self-modification).

- **LP (Logic of Paradox)**: A four-valued paraconsistent logic where formulas may take values True, False, Both, or Neither; the base logic of the framework.

- **Meme (corrected)**: Not a replicating "idea" but a portable distinction; culture evolves through irreversible symbolic cuts, not transmission of ideas.

- **Memetics (rehabilitated)**: Becomes coherent when memes are understood as distinctions that propagate by committing fields before reflection; dynamics were mostly correct, token was misidentified.

- **Metabolism (of form)**: The ongoing fold/unfold cycle; transformation of pressure into stable form and stable form into new pressure; symbolic life.

- **Modality (Level 4)**: States with modal classification; Box-phi (stability), Diamond-phi (reachability); the organizational level where self-description becomes possible.

- **Necessity (prospective)**: What holds across all ways the current state can stabilize; not a property of worlds but an emergent invariant of stabilization under pressure; necessity as vector, not status.

- **Organizational hierarchy**: What is being stabilized; Levels -2 (Physical Fluctuation) through 6 (Plastic Self).

- **P (plastic act)**: The operator that effects structural transformation of the type space: S_t -> S_{t+1}; boundary-fold at the level of identity.

- **Paraconsistency**: The logical property that contradictions do not explode; contradictions are localized rather than infecting all inferences.

- **Plastic self (Level 6)**: Not a single theory but a trajectory: S_0 -> S_1 -> S_2 -> ...; a self-propelling sequence of reorganizations.

- **Plasticity**: The capacity of a distinction to survive its own re-entry without collapsing into triviality or freezing into identity; not flexibility but the power to receive and produce form.

- **Policy-level**: Dynamics that determine transitions within a fixed configuration space; causal determination; changing variables within fixed rules.

- **Pressure**: Whatever resists full stabilization; the remainder that any stabilization leaves; the engine of generation (unfold).

- **Realization**: phi in s; the current state containing phi; distinct from commitment (Box-phi); not closed under consequence.

- **Recursive modality**: The unified framework; symbolic systems stabilize through recursive normalization with determinate formal properties generating modal, paraconsistent, and value-theoretic structure.

- **Re-entry**: Spencer-Brown's operation where a distinction is applied to itself, generating self-referential oscillation; the source of T-failure.

- **Remainder**: What resists stabilization, what escapes the fixed point; not waste but fuel for the next unfold; the generative residue.

- **S+1 (plastic transformation)**: Structural mutation of the self through one more self-distinction; not additive change but recursive re-entry.

- **Saturation (Baudrillardian)**: Distinction without consequence; cuts that proliferate without constraining anything; the evacuation of consequence from distinction.

- **Self**: The site where distinctions can still occur; exists only insofar as the system retains a place where distinction is possible; "just one distinction more than modality itself."

- **Stabilization**: The process by which symbolic systems reach fixed points; what generates modal, paraconsistent, and value-theoretic structure.

- **Standalone concepts**: Concepts that do not require an opposite to function (pressure, force, value, cost, intensity); scalar or directional, not contrastive.

- **Structural linguistics (critique)**: Correct about Level 2 (relational meaning in language) but wrong about Level 1 (distinction is atomic, not constituted by relations).

- **T axiom**: Box-phi -> phi; "if necessarily phi then phi"; INVALID in the framework on non-reflexive frames.

- **T-failure**: The invalidity of Box-phi -> phi; the formal signature of prospective necessity; an agent can be committed to phi without currently realizing phi.

- **Temporal hierarchy**: Each organizational level exhibits a distinct structure of time: Block time (-2), Pure duration (-1/0), Sequential time (1-2), Logical time (3), Branching time (4), Narrative time (5), Kairotic/epochal time (6).

- **Truth**: The state where the system can no longer not commit; exhaustion given conservativity/idempotence constraints.

- **Type reindexing**: Change in what counts as what (who is a person, what authority is legitimate); the mark of value-level transformation.

- **Unfold**: The dual of fold; generates new distinctions from pressure; unfold: Field x Press -> Form x Press; characterized by non-idempotence, pressure-monotonicity, remainder-feeding.

- **Value-level**: Constraints that determine the configuration space itself; non-causal determination; shaping what states are possible, not dynamics within them.

- **4 axiom**: Box-phi -> Box-Box-phi; the transitivity axiom; valid on transitive frames in the framework.

| 3 | Human | Self-modification | 4-6 | Theory |

### Temporal Hierarchy

| Level | Temporal Structure | Characterization |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| -2 | Block Time | No privileged "now"; spacetime as four-dimensional manifold |
| -1/0 | Pure Duration | Bergsonian; no discrete events, only continuous heterogeneous flow |
| 1-2 | Sequential Time | "This, then that"; discrete marks create discrete moments |

| 4 | Branching Time | Future as tree of possibilities |
| 5 | Narrative Time | Past retrospectively constructed for present identity |
| 6 | Kairotic/Epochal Time | Qualitative ruptures punctuate quantitative succession |

### Metabolic Regimes

| Regime | Condition | Behavior | Risk |
|--------|-----------|----------|------|
| Creative | Delta-I(unfold) > Delta-I(fold) | Novelty accumulates; exploration | Dissolution |
| Homeostatic | Delta-I(unfold) approx Delta-I(fold) | Dynamic equilibrium; living flow | Metastable |
| Crystalline | Delta-I(unfold) < Delta-I(fold) | Rigidity increases; stasis | Death-by-order |

### Recursion Condition (R)

- R(0): No representation of cuts (Locus 0)
- R(1): Can represent self/non-self (Locus 1)
- R(2): Can represent patterns about the world (Locus 2)
- R(3): Can represent and modify the act of patterning (Locus 3)


## Formal Properties

### Fold Operator Properties (Verified in Agda 2.7.0.1)

1. **Idempotence**: fold(fold(Phi)) = fold(Phi)
   - Folding twice yields same result as folding once
   - Interpretation: Reflective equilibrium

2. **Conservativity**: atoms(fold(Phi)) subseteq atoms(Phi)
   - Folding introduces no new atoms
   - Interpretation: Epistemic integrity

3. **Contradiction-preservation**: Exists Phi, p, q such that (p in fold(Phi)) and (not-p in fold(Phi)) and (q notin fold(Phi))
   - Contradictions are localized, not explosive
   - Interpretation: Paraconsistency

### Modal Semantics

- **Admissible states**: S = {Phi in Pfin(Form) | fold(Phi) = Phi}
- **Transition function**: F: S -> P(S)
- **Modal operators**:
  - M, s |= Box-phi iff for all t in F+(s): M, t |= phi
  - M, s |= Diamond-phi iff for some t in F+(s): M, t |= phi

### Validity Results

- **K Valid**: Box(phi -> psi) -> (Box-phi -> Box-psi)
- **4 Valid**: Box-phi -> Box-Box-phi (on transitive frames)
- **T Invalid**: Box-phi -> phi (on non-reflexive frames)

### T-Failure Countermodel

- s = {q}, fold-stable
- t = {p, q}, fold-stable
- F(s) = {t}, so s notin F(s)
- Box-p holds at s (all successors contain p)
- p fails at s (s = {q}, p notin s)
- Therefore M, s |= Box-p and not-p

### Unfold Properties (Characterized, not verified)

1. **Non-idempotence (Creative)**: Exists (F, P) such that pi_1(unfold(unfold(F, P))) neq pi_1(unfold(F, P))
2. **Pressure-monotonicity**: P leq P' implies novelty(unfold(F, P)) leq novelty(unfold(F, P'))
3. **Remainder-feeding**: rem(unfold(F, P)) = P_u (new pressure generated by creation)

### Metabolic Invariance Conjecture

For any system satisfying fold/unfold coupling laws, the trajectory step^n preserves non-triviality iff pressure never vanishes on a tail of the trajectory.

### Filter Equation (Top-down constraint)

F_{-1} proportional to I_5 / Tolerance(P)

Where:
- I_5 = incompleteness/fragility of identity-theory
- F_{-1} = tightness of attention filter
- P = pressure from unintegrated experience

### Commutation Up to Remainder

fold compose unfold approx unfold compose fold (mod Press)


## Applications

### Epistemology
- **Logical omniscience**: Dissolved by distinguishing commitment (Box-phi, closed under consequence) from realization (phi in s, not closed)
- **Belief revision**: Configurations may contain contradictions; fold preserves atomic contradictions while eliminating derived ones
- **Structural rationality**: The requirement to stabilize; not external but internal logic of reasons-responsiveness
- **Understanding**: Achievement of fold-stability; "aha!" moment is rapid transition from unstable to stable configuration

### Philosophy of Science
- **Scientific convergence**: Value-level constraints shape what counts as legitimate research; benchmarks are stabilization operators
- **Stable disagreement**: Scientific communities are fold-stable with contradictory commitments (QM/GR); contradictions are productive
- **Benchmark dynamics**: Displacement requires value-level intervention, not just policy-level critique
- **Non-causal explanation**: Value-level explanations showing configuration space constraints

### Phenomenology
- **Horizonality**: T-failure formalizes the horizon (Box-phi and not-phi); implicit co-intentions not yet fulfilled
- **Attention**: Unfold (articulating field) coupled with fold (stabilizing articulation)
- **Gestalt**: Fixed points of perceptual fold; gestalt switches as transitions between fixed points
- **Temporality**: Fold/unfold cycle is essentially temporal; arrow of experienced time = direction of metabolism

### Social Ontology
- **Social kinds**: Fold-stable configurations of collective commitment; "money" exists as self-reproducing configuration
- **Looping effects**: Category shapes behavior, behavior shapes category; the loop is the metabolism
- **Collective contradiction**: Societies can be fold-stable with incompatible values (liberty/equality)
- **Cultural plasticity**: Major transformations are boundary-folds; type reindexing followed by new contradictions

### AI and Technology
- **LLM reasoning**: Distinct behavioral profiles as metabolic regimes; regime control via decoding parameters and prompting
- **Human-LLM difference**: Humans inhabit the gap (Box-phi and not-phi); LLMs instantiate results without dwelling in trajectory
- **Alignment**: Policy-level (training trajectories) vs. value-level (attractor landscapes); value-level misalignment resists policy fixes
- **Contradiction-aware design**: Preserve contradiction, localize it, present alternatives, flag remainder

### Memetics (Rehabilitated)
- Culture evolves through irreversible symbolic cuts, not transmission of ideas
- Memes as distinctions that propagate by committing fields before reflection
- Dynamics of memetics correct; token ("idea") misidentified; should be "distinction"

### Baudrillard / Cultural Saturation
- Collapse is not disappearance of distinction but distinction without consequence
- Saturation = cuts that proliferate without constraining anything
- Fold offers escape: not more distinctions but reintroducing constraint and depth


## Speculative/Underdeveloped

### Unfold Verification
- **Current state**: Characterized philosophically but not mechanically verified
- **What's missing**: Precise type-theoretic definition; verification of dual properties; proof of coupling laws
- **Challenge**: Unfold is generative (non-terminating), making verification harder than convergent fold

### Category-Theoretic Formulation
- **Current state**: Suggested that fold/unfold may be adjoint functors
- **What's missing**: Formal definition of category Config; characterization as adjoint pair; initiality/terminality results
- **Significance**: Would reveal abstract structure, enable new proof techniques

### Multi-Agent Fold
- **Current state**: Framework treats single systems
- **What's missing**: Configurations for multi-agent systems; whose fold dominates; politics of imposed stabilization
- **Challenge**: May not converge, may oscillate, game-theoretic dynamics

### Continuous Configurations
- **Current state**: Framework treats finite configurations
- **What's missing**: Extension to infinite-dimensional spaces; connection to dynamical systems theory
- **Significance**: Would enable applications to neural dynamics, physical systems

### Third Death (Overload)
- **Current state**: Two deaths identified (crystallization, dissolution)
- **What's missing**: Analysis of overload (remainder accumulates faster than fold can process)
- **Question**: Does metabolic coupling ensure bounded pressure?

### Normative Grounding of Fold
- **Current state**: Fold treated as constitutive of rationality
- **What's missing**: Why should one stabilize? Constitutive, pragmatic, or transcendental argument?
- **Challenge**: Each approach faces objections

### Value-Level Relativism
- **Current state**: Different systems have different value constraints
- **What's missing**: Grounds for preferring one value regime over another
- **Approach**: Local relativism accepted, global rejected via meta-level properties

### Ontological Status of Remainder
- **Current state**: "What resists stabilization"
- **What's missing**: Is remainder real (part of the world) or epistemic (feature of representations)?
- **Open question**: Is there a "universal remainder" resisting all folds?

### Neural Correlates
- **Current state**: Framework silent on implementation
- **What's missing**: What neural processes correspond to fold? Single mechanism or class?
- **Candidates**: Predictive processing, attractor dynamics, neural oscillations

### Deliberate Dissolution
- **Current state**: Can a Locus 3 system choose to stop stabilizing?
- **What's missing**: Is deliberate dissolution coherent? Self-undermining? Limit-approaching?
- **Connection**: Spiritual traditions, psychedelic phenomenology, identity continuity


## Key Quotes

### On Distinction as Primitive
> "Distinction is not a concept within the theory but the invariant token from which all form, inference, modality, selfhood, and plastic transformation are composed."

> "Distinction is atomic and constitutes level one; form and relation arise only at level two through the syntactic binding of distinctions."

### On Becoming
> "A distinction is not drawn by an agent upon a field; it becomes through a committed orientation whose outcome is not known in advance, and whose result is itself the distinction."

> "If distinction itself must become, then time, identity, necessity, and meaning are not primitives but consequences of a cut that resists its own completion."

### On T-Failure
> "The failure of Box-phi -> phi is not a logical weakness but the formal signature of becoming: an interval in which necessity exerts pressure without yet collapsing into actuality."

> "The gap between Box-phi and phi is where we live. Inquiry, deliberation, understanding, creation: all inhabit the gap, all traverse the space between what we're bound to and what we've achieved."

### On the Fold
> "A fold is a distinction whose scope includes prior distinctions, producing ontological change without introducing a new operation."

> "Folding repositions an existing distinction by applying a new distinction at a broader scope, thereby shifting the underlying ontology without introducing a new primitive."

> "Folding does not resolve distinction; it relocates it."

### On the Self
> "The self is one distinction more than modality itself."

> "The self is not an entity that persists through becoming; it exists only insofar as the system retains a site where distinction can still occur."

> "The self exists because the system has one more place where it can cut."

### On S+1 / Plasticity
> "Plastic transformation occurs not by multiplying distinctions, but by forcing a single self-distinction to re-enter itself, producing S+1 through recursive delay rather than additive change."

> "Plasticity is the capacity of a distinction to survive its own re-entry without collapsing into triviality or freezing into identity."

### On the Metabolism
> "Life is the coupling [of fold and unfold]."

> "The remainder is not waste but fuel."

> "Death is when step ceases to produce meaningful change--either because form has dissolved (nothing to stabilize) or because pressure has vanished (nothing to generate from)."

### On Memetics
> "Memetics becomes coherent once memes are understood not as replicating ideas, but as distinctions that propagate by committing fields before reflection."

> "Culture evolves through irreversible symbolic cuts, not through the transmission of ideas."

### On Baudrillard / Saturation
> "Baudrillard's saturation does not mark the disappearance of distinction, but its evacuation of consequence: a regime in which cuts proliferate while no further folds remain possible."

### On Post-Hegelianism
> "The framework offers dialectic without teleology, system without totality, process without endpoint."

### On the Framework's Unity
> "The wager of this framework is that recursive stabilization is not one phenomenon among many but a fundamental structure--that the movement from pressure through distinction to stable configuration is how symbolic systems as such operate."
