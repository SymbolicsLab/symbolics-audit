## 1. SHIMMER
**Source**: York abstract ("Before the Cut"), NTNU abstract ("Attention as Fold")
**Insight**: Shimmer is the experiential trace of ineffability—the structural residue left when experience crosses from undivided to divided form. Not a failure of language but "a reminder of its origin." Connects to: bistable perception (Necker cube), musical absorption, déjà vu, aesthetic presence. Formally: the interference pattern that persists after the cut.
**Theoretical significance**: Shimmer may be the *phenomenological correlate* of remainder. If remainder is the formal concept and shimmer is the felt quality, they should be linked explicitly. This also connects to the Physics abstract's claim about residual interference patterns.
**Route**: → Vault (new) — create `01_concepts/Shimmer.md` or `drafts/Shimmer.md`. Link to Remainder, Cut, Attention.

## 2. ACQUAINTANCE AS PRE-CUT PHASE
**Source**: York abstract
**Insight**: Acquaintance (in the Russell/Fumerton sense) is not a standing epistemic relation but a *temporal phase* of cognition—"the condition of participation in what has not yet been divided." Before the cut, there is an unbroken field. The cut transforms this into subject/object, figure/ground. This explains why acquaintance is ineffable: speaking of it requires the very cut that destroys it.
**Theoretical significance**: This gives content to Level -1/0. The pre-distinction field is not empty or unknowable; it is *participated in* but not *articulated*. This is different from "nothing" and different from "chaos." It's experienced fullness prior to form.
**Route**: → Vault (new) — create `drafts/Acquaintance.md`. Link to Cut, Organizational Hierarchy (Level -1/0), Shimmer.

## 3. STRUCTURED OPACITY
**Source**: Hong Kong abstract ("Legibility as Ontological Destruction")
**Insight**: For AI companionship, total transparency destroys the conditions for genuine encounter. "Structured opacity" = deliberate preservation of variation zones that allow the other to remain other. Design principles: opacity budgets (what may vary vs. must be constrained), remainder-aware memory, contrast-safe persona, relational benchmarking.
**Theoretical significance**: This is a direct application of the remainder concept to AI design. Remainder isn't just something that *happens*; it should sometimes be *preserved by design*. "Reserved remainder" as architectural principle. Connects to: Glissant's right to opacity, Buber's I-Thou/I-It.
**Route**: → Vault (new) — create `drafts/Structured Opacity.md`. Link to Remainder, LLM Phenomenology, Ethics of Distinction. Also → Open Problem on AI applications.

## 4. OVER-VISIBILITY AS RECURSIVE ATTENTION EFFECT
**Source**: Ca' Foscari abstract ("The Over-Visible")
**Insight**: Invisibility is not absence of representation but a temporal effect of *over-visibility*. When attention stabilizes a surface too strongly, underlying operations become imperceptible. "The invisible is what attention has rendered too smooth to question." Hyper-visible bodies (racialized, disabled, feminized) are structurally unreadable *because* of excess visibility.
**Theoretical significance**: This extends the Inverted Filter to politics. The filter doesn't just exclude; it can over-include, creating a different kind of blindness. Over-stabilization at the attention level produces surfaces without depth—distinction without fold. Connects to Baudrillard reframe (distinction without consequence).
**Route**: → Vault (update) — add to `drafts/The Inverted Filter.md` and `drafts/Baudrillard reframe.md`.

---

## 5. SELF-CENSORSHIP AS NARRATIVE'S FOUNDING CUT
**Source**: Diffractions abstract ("The Narrative of Contradiction")
**Insight**: Before sequence, there is simultaneity—overlapping, incompatible pressures. Narrative emerges when this simultaneity is *cut*: one strand followed, others excluded. Self-censorship is not imposed from outside but structural to storytelling. Remainder = excluded threads. Platform moderation automates this: the cut encoded as content policy.
**Theoretical significance**: Narrative itself is a fold operation—reducing simultaneity to sequence. This connects to the temporal hierarchy (Levels 5-6). Also: when censorship becomes total, "nothing is excluded because nothing can resist interpretation" = exhaustion = Baudrillard's saturation restated.
**Route**: → Vault (new) — create `drafts/Narrative as Fold.md`. Link to Fold, Temporal Hierarchy, Baudrillard reframe.

---

## 6. IRRATIONALITY AS RECURSIVE PRESSURE
**Source**: Bonn abstract ("Irrationality as Recursive Pressure")
**Insight**: Both human and LLM irrationality share an architecture: they arise when systems amplify incompatible signals faster than stabilization can resolve them. Irrationality = recursion problem, not epistemic failure. Hallucinations = structural consequences of recursive over-generation. Rumination, obsession, panic = excessive reentry under affective pressure.
**Theoretical significance**: This reframes "irrationality" within the metabolic framework. Irrationality is the creative regime without sufficient fold—unfold dominance approaching dissolution. This also predicts: different *kinds* of irrationality depending on which metabolic regime is disrupted.
**Route**: → Vault (update) — add to `drafts/LLM Phenomenology.md`. Also create `drafts/Irrationality.md` linking to Metabolism, Dissolution vs Crystallization.

---

## 7. BIMODAL REGIME DATA
**Source**: UNILOG Two Regimes experiment
**Insight**: Across 36 reasoning tasks, LLM behavior clusters into two distinct regimes with no overlap. Selective (AULC > 1.1): rapid convergence, single hidden cause. Exploratory (AULC < 0.6): sustained ambiguity, multiple frameworks. Gap of 0.548. Cohen's d ≈ 4.0. Domain-independent (medical clusters with engineering, legal with business). Order affects intensity but not regime membership.
**Theoretical significance**: This is *empirical evidence* for the two-regime prediction. The selective regime looks like fold-dominant (convergence to fixed point). The exploratory regime looks like fold/unfold balance or unfold-dominant (sustained multiplicity). The clean bimodal separation is consistent with the theory's claim that these are structurally distinct modes, not endpoints of a continuum.
**Route**: → Vault (new) — create `05_examples/LLM Regime Data.md`. → Open Problem X.2 (falsifiability): partially confirmed.

## 8. MODEL TRANSFER AS VALUE-LEVEL STRUCTURE SHARING
**Source**: Hannover abstract ("From Borrowed Templates to Working Models")
**Insight**: Models transfer across domains when researchers construct a "stabilization procedure"—a public, repeatable settlement of the policy layer linking messy descriptions to model variables. Transfer yields traction only when this policy layer is explicitly constructed. Progress in transfer-heavy fields is measured by maturity of stabilization procedures, not by verisimilitude of the template.
**Theoretical significance**: This is the value/policy distinction applied to philosophy of science. The template = value-level structure. The stabilization procedure = policy-level settlement. "A field can progress even while its core ontology remains contested" = progress at the policy level while value-level questions remain open. This is directly relevant to symbolics' own methodology.
**Route**: → Vault (update) — add to `03_distinctions/Value vs Policy.md`. Also relevant to Open Problem X.1 (is this one theory or several?).

---

## 9. FOLD AS DIALOGUE
**Source**: Konstanz abstract ("The Fold as Dialogue")
**Insight**: The fold is an intrinsically *dialogical* operation. "Every fold implies two surfaces in contact, each shaping and being shaped by the other." The fold replaces dialectical resolution with dialogical recursion: where dialectic seeks convergence, the fold sustains pressure. Attention, perception, and contradiction are all forms of dialogue.
**Theoretical significance**: This is a different intuition from "canonical normalization." Normalization is monological (one operator acting on one configuration). Dialogue is bi-directional (two configurations affecting each other). This may point to something the LP formalization misses—fold as interaction, not just cleanup. Connects to multi-agent extension (S.4).
**Route**: → Vault (new) — create `drafts/Fold as Dialogue.md`. Link to Fold, Konstanz presentation.

## 10. SCIENTIA OF RELATION / FACT-VALUE CO-GENERATION
**Source**: AI & Society abstract ("Beyond Art + Science")
**Insight**: Modern technicity enforces a split between "matters of fact" (measurement) and "matters of value" (evaluation). But both emerge from the same operation: cut (distinguishes), fold (sustains), remainder (preserves what can't be internalized). Design criteria for "relational instruments": traceability of reentry, reserved remainder, intrinsic evaluation.
**Theoretical significance**: The theory doesn't just *analyze* the fact/value distinction—it dissolves it. Fact and value are co-generated by the same cut. This is a strong philosophical claim with practical design implications. The three design criteria could become a design methodology.
**Route**: → Vault (new) — create `drafts/Fact-Value Co-generation.md`. Also feed into Open Problem on ethics/normativity.

---

## 11. PERCEPTION AS ERROR SUSPENSION (NOT ERROR CORRECTION)
**Source**: NTNU abstract ("Attention as Fold")
**Insight**: Predictive coding treats perception as error minimization. The fold model inverts this: "Rather than correcting error, attention sustains it as tension, because experience must remain dynamically open to renewal—total correction would erase the conditions of novelty." Perception = error *suspension* = temporary stabilization of difference within continuity.
**Theoretical significance**: This directly challenges predictive processing / FEP's standard formulation. If attention *preserves* error rather than minimizing it, the metabolic account diverges from FEP at a precise point. This is relevant to C.1 (FEP dual): the duality might not be exact but *contrastive*.
**Route**: → Vault (update) — add to `drafts/Attention.md`. → Open Problem C.1 (FEP dual).

---

## 12. MARY'S ROOM REINTERPRETED
**Source**: York abstract
**Insight**: Mary doesn't gain new propositional content; she enters "the pre-cut field of color experience." The standard presentation (knowledge-that → acquaintance) inverts the natural order. The "knowledge gap" is "the generative cost of cognition itself." Ineffability marks the transition from pre-cut to post-cut, not a deficit of physical explanation.
**Route**: → Vault (new) — could be an example in `05_examples/`.

---

## 13. THE FILTER EQUATION AND PATHOLOGICAL STATES
**Source**: Synthesis Part III §12.5, The Inverted Filter draft
**Insight**: Three pathological filter states: over-tight (rigidity, OCD, rigid personality), under-tight (flooding, psychosis, dissociation), oscillating (instability, borderline patterns, bipolar cycling). The plastic act = the moment the filter breaks. Previously filtered data floods the system, forcing identity-theory reorganization.
**Theoretical significance**: This is a testable clinical prediction. Different psychiatric conditions correspond to different filter pathologies. This could be mapped to existing psychiatric frameworks (DSM categories, dimensional models) and tested.
**Route**: → Vault (update) — add clinical predictions to `drafts/Trauma.md` and `drafts/The Inverted Filter.md`. → Open Problem on empirical testing.

---

## 14. LEGIBILITY VS OPACITY TRADE-OFF (GENERAL FORM)
**Source**: Hong Kong abstract, Ca' Foscari abstract, Diffractions abstract
**Insight**: Multiple abstracts converge on the same structure: total legibility destroys the conditions for genuine encounter/creativity/meaning. The theory provides a formal reason: total stabilization eliminates remainder, and without remainder the metabolism stops. Opacity = preserved remainder = condition of ongoing life.
**Theoretical significance**: This is not just an AI design point or a political point; it's a general principle derivable from the metabolism. Total fold without remainder = crystallization = death. Therefore some opacity is *structurally necessary* for any living system.
**Route**: → Vault (new) — create `04_claims/Total legibility is ontological destruction.md` or similar.
