# Symbolics: Completeness Map
**Version**: 0.2.0 | **Date**: 2026-02-01 | **Status**: Updated with layered formalization scope

This document tracks every theoretical commitment in symbolics against its status across all layers: theory (vault/notes), formalization (Agda), implementation (DSL), and audit tracking. It extends the compatibility audit from alignment-checking to completeness and coherence assessment.

---

## Layered Formalization Scope (ADR-001, ADR-002)

**Critical framing**: The formal layer does not cover the whole theory. Distinction is pre-logical and pre-propositional—the theory claims logic is *generated by* distinction, not the other way around.

### What the Agda formalizes (Level 2+)

| Level | Content | Formal Status |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| 2 | Propositional structure, LP/FDE semantics | ✅ Verified (LP), in progress (FDE) |
| 3 | Inferential structure, modal semantics | ✅ Verified (T-failure, K, 4) |
| 4+ | Higher organizational levels | ❌ Unformalized |

FDE-fold (ADR-001) covers **stabilization within an already-distinguished domain**. The three properties (idempotence, conservativity, contradiction-preservation) are properties of this stabilization. This is real and worth proving—but it's not the whole theory.

### What the Agda does NOT formalize (Levels -1/0/1)

| Level | Content | Formal Status |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| -2 | Quantum field / pure potentiality | ❌ Not formalizable in current approach |
| -1 | Pre-cut field (acquaintance, shimmer) | ❌ Formally open (ADR-002) |
| 0 | The act of distinction (cut as domain-creation) | ❌ Formally open (ADR-002) |
| 1 | Immediate polarity (before stabilization) | ⚠️ Partially implicit |

The pre-propositional layer is where the theory's distinctive claims live. Formalizing it may require:
- Topological semantics (distinction as boundary-drawing)
- Game semantics (distinction as interactive)
- Domain theory (pre-cut as partial information)
- Homotopy type theory (distinction as path structure)

**This is ADR-002's open thread.** No implementation until theoretical clarification. The FDE work will reveal where truth-functional approaches break; those breakages will inform what the pre-propositional layer requires.

### Practical implication

When reading entries below, note which level they belong to:
- **Level 2+ entries**: FDE-fold path applies; formal work can proceed
- **Level -1/0/1 entries**: Formally open; theory work needed before Agda

## I. PRIMITIVES AND CORE ONTOLOGY

### I.1 Distinction (Cut)
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ✅ Canonical | `01_concepts/Distinction.md`, `drafts/Cut.md` |
| Agda | ✅ Verified | `Mechanics/Primitive.agda` — `Cut` record: `{apply : U → Side}` |
| DSL | ⚠️ Implicit | Used structurally but not exposed as first-class |
| Audit | ✅ Tracked | Part of SPEC-REM-001 and core ontology specs |

**Dependencies**: Requires nothing (primitive). Required by: everything.
**Open Questions**:
- Theory says distinction "becomes" rather than "is drawn." Is this dynamism captured in the Agda, or is Cut static?
- Cut is typed as `U → Side`, producing a result but hiding the mechanism. Is this the right opacity? Or should the process of cutting be modeled?
- The draft note on Cut and the canonical note on Distinction overlap but aren't unified. Which is authoritative?

**Scattered Insights**:
- York abstract ("Before the Cut"): Acquaintance is a *phase before* distinction, not a standing relation. "Shimmer" = structural residue of the cut. Ineffability = necessary remainder of any distinction. This implies Level -1/0 has genuine content that Cut destroys/transforms.
- NTNU abstract ("Attention as Fold"): Attention IS the Cut at perceptual level. Not a spotlight but a recursive operation.
- Physics abstract ("Self as Measurement"): Cut parallels quantum measurement—both are "recursive stabilization of difference within initially undivided field."

---

### I.2 Side (Two-Channel Distinction)
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ⚠️ Implicit | Not a standalone vault note; embedded in Distinction/Truth |
| Agda | ✅ Verified | `Mechanics/Primitive.agda` — `record {truth : Truth; resolved : Resolved}` |
| DSL | ⚠️ Partial | `runtime/side.ts` implements Side operations |
| Audit | ✅ Tracked | Multiple specs reference Side |

**Dependencies**: Requires Truth, Resolved. Required by: Cut, Phenomenon, all operations.
**Open Questions**:
- **Critical**: Side = Truth × Resolved. Truth has four values (Neither/In/Out/Both = Belnap FDE). But the fold proofs use LP (three-value). The Agda ontology is richer than the logic the proofs operate over. Is this a gap?
- Is the binary Resolved (Res/Unres) sufficient? Should pressure admit gradation?
- `sideRem = mkSide Neither Unres` — remainder has no polarity but has pressure. Is this the right encoding?

---

### I.3 Truth (Polarity)
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ✅ Canonical | `01_concepts/Truth.md` |
| Agda | ✅ Verified | `Mechanics/Primitive.agda` — `record {supportsIn : Bool; supportsOut : Bool}` |
| DSL | ✅ Implemented | `runtime/side.ts` |
| Audit | ✅ Tracked | |

**Dependencies**: Primitive. Required by: Side.
**Open Questions**:
- **FOUNDATIONAL**: Four truth values (Neither/In/Out/Both) = Belnap FDE. But what is the *right* logic for the theory? See Open Problem F.1.
- The theory talks about pressure preceding polarity (Level 0). Truth captures polarity but not pre-polarity pressure. Is this a limitation?

---

### I.4 Resolved (Pressure Channel)
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ⚠️ Draft | `drafts/Pressure.md` (covers pressure; Resolved as such is unnamed) |
| Agda | ✅ Verified | `Mechanics/Primitive.agda` — `data Resolved = Res | Unres` |
| DSL | ✅ Implemented | |
| Audit | ✅ Tracked | |

**Dependencies**: Primitive. Required by: Side, Remainder, Metabolism.
**Open Questions**:
- Binary (Res/Unres) vs. graded pressure. The theory describes pressure as a continuous driver; the formalism makes it a tag.
- What is the relationship between Resolved and the "pressure" concept in the theory? Are they the same thing?

---

### I.5 Phenomenon
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ❌ Missing | No vault note. Implicit in the distinction between Cut (opaque) and its result |
| Agda | ✅ Verified | `Mechanics/Primitive.agda` — `record {locus : U; val : Side}` |
| DSL | ❌ Missing | |
| Audit | 🔍 Unclear | |

**Dependencies**: Requires Cut, Side. Required by: observation/measurement.
**Open Questions**:
- Phenomenon = observable result of Cut. "System sees only the Side, never the Cut itself." This is philosophically important (opacity of mechanism) but has no theory note.
- Is Phenomenon the formal correlate of "shimmer" from the York abstract?

---

## II. OPERATIONS

### II.1 Fold
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ✅ Canonical | `01_concepts/Fold.md`, plus drafts on taxonomy, idempotence |
| Agda | ✅ Verified | `Modal/.../LP/Entailment.agda:114-123` (literal fold), `ConfigFold.agda` (configuration fold) |
| DSL | ⚠️ Placeholder | `runtime/fold.ts` — marked as placeholder, does not match Agda semantics |
| Audit | ✅ Tracked | SPEC-FOLD-* series |

**Dependencies**: Requires LP Semantics, Configuration. Required by: Admissible States, Modal Semantics, Metabolism.
**Open Questions**:
- **CRITICAL**: Fold is defined over LP. Theory implies it should work over FDE (or something richer). Do the three properties hold over FDE entailment?
- Fold is the LP-specific canonical normalization. But the theory claims fold is a *universal* operation (every level performs one). Is there a *general* fold of which LP-fold is one instance?
- DSL fold is a placeholder. This means the implementation layer doesn't actually run the verified operator.
- The Synthesis (Ch.7-8) says `fold ∘ unfold` is the metabolic tick. But fold alone is what's verified. The composition isn't formalized.

**Scattered Insights**:
- UNILOG "Folding Contradiction" script: Fold as canonical normalization is "the coarsest map that preserves exactly what the logic is sensitive to." This is a *characterization*, not just a definition. Different logics → different folds. This suggests fold should be parameterized by logic.
- Konstanz abstract: "Fold as Dialogue" — fold is not just normalization but an intrinsically dialogical operation. Two surfaces in contact, each shaping the other. This is a different intuition from "canonical normalization" and may point to something the LP formalization misses.

---

### II.2 Unfold
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ✅ Canonical | `01_concepts/Unfold.md` |
| Agda | ❌ Missing | No implementation. Term appears informally in Transition.agda line 17 |
| DSL | ⚠️ Placeholder | `explore` fold in DSL is named "unfold" but is not formally grounded |
| Audit | ⚠️ | Tracked as gap |

**Dependencies**: Requires Pressure, Field. Required by: Metabolism, Creative regime, all dynamics.
**Open Questions**:
- **CRITICAL**: This is the biggest formal gap. The metabolism needs both fold and unfold; only fold is implemented.
- Synthesis specifies: `unfold : Field × Press → Form × Press`. What are Field and Press formally? Can they be encoded in Agda's type system?
- Unfold properties (non-idempotent, pressure-monotone, remainder-feeding) are conjectured. None proven.
- User reports unfold is "least intuitive." This suggests the concept may need further theoretical clarification before formalization.

**Scattered Insights**:
- Synthesis Ch.7 maps unfold at each level: measurement/decoherence (-2→-1), attention as cut (-1→1), syntactic binding (1→2), inference (2→3), plastic act (5→6). These are very different operations. Is "unfold" a single operation or a family?

---

### II.3 Reentry
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ⚠️ Draft | `drafts/Reentry.md` |
| Agda | ⚠️ Implicit | Not directly modeled; appears structurally in T-failure and recursion |
| DSL | ❌ Missing | |
| Audit | ❌ Untracked | |

**Dependencies**: Requires Distinction. Required by: T-failure, Plasticity, Self, reflexivity.
**Open Questions**:
- Reentry is arguably the mechanism that *generates* levels. A distinction applied to itself produces the next organizational level. But this isn't formalized.
- Is reentry a *separate* operation from fold? The theory sometimes treats them as the same ("one cut = one fold"), sometimes as different (reentry as recursion, fold as normalization).

---

## III. PROPERTIES OF FOLD

### III.1 Idempotence
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ✅ Canonical | `01_concepts/Fold.md`, `drafts/Idempotence.md` |
| Agda | ✅ Verified | `ConfigFoldIdempotent.agda` |
| DSL | ❌ Not tested | |
| Audit | ✅ Tracked | |

**Open Questions**:
- Proven for LP fold over finite literal configurations. Does it hold for FDE? For richer logics?
- User flags: "not sure the properties always hold in all contexts." In what contexts might idempotence *fail*, and would that failure be informative?
- Idempotence assumes closed system during fold. Real systems have continuous input. Is there a notion of "approximate idempotence" or "idempotence modulo new input"?

---

### III.2 Conservativity
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ✅ Canonical | `drafts/Conservativity.md` |
| Agda | ✅ Verified | `ConfigFoldConservative.agda` |
| DSL | ❌ Not tested | |
| Audit | ✅ Tracked | |

**Open Questions**:
- If fold is conservative and unfold introduces novelty, the metabolism requires *both* to function. Novelty comes from outside fold—from unfold, from new evidence via transitions, or from the environment. This needs to be explicit.
- Conservativity is a strength (no fabrication) and a limitation (no creation). The theory needs both. Is this a feature or a tension?

---

### III.3 Contradiction-Preservation
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ✅ Canonical | `01_concepts/Contradiction-preservation.md`, `drafts/Contradiction-preservation.md` |
| Agda | ✅ Verified | `ConfigFoldContradiction.agda` |
| DSL | ❌ Not tested | |
| Audit | ✅ Tracked | |

**Open Questions**:
- Proven for atomic contradictions in LP. What about *structural* contradictions at higher levels (conflicting identity-theories, not just conflicting literals)?
- The theory claims contradiction is "cheaper to contain than resolve." Is there a formal cost metric that makes this precise?
- LP treats Both as designated. Is this the right choice? FDE doesn't designate Both by default. The choice of designation logic matters.

---

## IV. MODAL SEMANTICS

### IV.1 T-failure (Interval of Becoming)
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ✅ Canonical | `01_concepts/T-failure.md`, `01_concepts/Interval of Becoming.md` |
| Agda | ✅ Verified | `Mechanics/TFailure.agda` — two-state countermodel |
| DSL | ❌ Missing | |
| Audit | ✅ Tracked | SPEC-MODAL-001 |

**Open Questions**:
- The proof is a minimal countermodel (two states, one transition). Does T-failure persist in richer models? Is it *typical* or *occasional*?
- The theory says T-failure generates the interval of becoming. The Agda proves the axiom can fail. But the Agda doesn't model anything *happening* in the interval. The dynamics of becoming are unformalized.
- Relationship to non-reflexive frames is clear. But when should frames be non-reflexive? What *makes* a state not its own successor?

---

### IV.2 Admissible States / Stability
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ✅ Canonical | `01_concepts/Admissible State.md` |
| Agda | ✅ Verified | `Modal/.../LP/State.agda` — `stable? s = equiv? s (fold (Φof s))` |
| DSL | ⚠️ Partial | |
| Audit | ✅ Tracked | |

---

### IV.3 Transition Relation (Accessibility)
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ⚠️ Implicit | Discussed in Synthesis but no dedicated vault note |
| Agda | ✅ Verified | `Transition.agda`, `License.agda` — step adds one formula, re-folds, checks license |
| DSL | ⚠️ Partial | |
| Audit | ✅ Tracked | |

**Open Questions**:
- License requires exactly one new literal per step. Is this a design choice or a limitation? The theory describes larger perturbations (unfold adding many distinctions).
- The transition relation is deterministic given a formula to add. Where does choice/agency enter?

---

## V. HIERARCHIES

### V.1 Organizational Hierarchy (Levels -2 to 6)
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ✅ Canonical | `01_concepts/Organizational Hierarchy.md` |
| Agda | ⚠️ Implicit | Type composition (U → Cut U → Fold) encodes ~3 levels; Levels 3-6 not represented |
| DSL | ❌ Missing | |
| Audit | ❌ Untracked | |

**Open Questions**:
- **CRITICAL**: How do levels above 2 formalize? Is the current type structure sufficient, or does new machinery (higher-order types, universes) become necessary?
- The level transitions (how you get from Level n to Level n+1) are described theoretically but not formalized. What is the type signature of level transition?
- Levels -2 through 0 (physical, pre-experiential) are claimed but never formally engaged. What would it mean to formalize them?

---

### V.2 Locus Hierarchy (Levels 0 to 3)
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ✅ Canonical | `01_concepts/Locus Hierarchy.md` |
| Agda | ❌ Missing | No formal representation |
| DSL | ❌ Missing | |
| Audit | ❌ Untracked | |

**Open Questions**:
- The locus hierarchy explains *who* stabilizes. The Agda implements fold but doesn't encode who runs it. Is this a feature (fold is substrate-independent) or a gap?
- The theory claims LLMs are Locus 1-2. What formal criterion distinguishes locus levels?

---

### V.3 Temporal Hierarchy
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ⚠️ In Synthesis only | Synthesis part 1, §3.10. No vault note |
| Agda | ❌ Missing | |
| DSL | ❌ Missing | |
| Audit | ❌ Untracked | |

**Open Questions**:
- Each organizational level produces its own temporal structure (block time → duration → sequential → logical → branching → narrative → kairotic). This is a strong claim. Is it testable?
- "Time is produced by fold at each level, not a background parameter." If true, this has deep implications for physics connections.

---

### V.4 Inverted Filter / Top-Down Constraint
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ⚠️ Draft | `drafts/The Inverted Filter.md`, Synthesis Part III §12.5 |
| Agda | ❌ Missing | |
| DSL | ❌ Missing | |
| Audit | ❌ Untracked | |

**Open Questions**:
- The hierarchy is a *circuit*, not just a ladder: bottom-up construction + top-down constraint. This is described in the Synthesis but not in the core vault concepts.
- Filter equation: F₋₁ ∝ S₅ / Tolerance(P). Can this be formalized? What types do F₋₁, S₅, P have?
- The inverted filter connects to: confirmation bias, perceptual defense, ideological closure, trauma, plasticity as filter breakdown. These are rich applications but depend on unformalized machinery.
- Hong Kong abstract ("Legibility as Ontological Destruction") applies this to AI companionship: over-visibility as over-tight stabilization. "Structured opacity" as design principle.

---

## VI. MECHANISMS

### VI.1 The Metabolism (Fold/Unfold Coupling)
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ✅ Canonical | `02_mechanisms/The Metabolism.md`, Synthesis Part III |
| Agda | ⚠️ Half-implemented | Fold verified; Unfold missing; coupling unformalized |
| DSL | ⚠️ Partial | Runtime loop implements a step cycle but not grounded in Agda |
| Audit | ⚠️ Partial | Fold tracked; metabolism as whole not tracked |

**Open Questions**:
- Without unfold, the metabolism is formally one-sided. This is the single most important gap.
- Three regimes (creative, homeostatic, crystalline) are described but not formally characterized.
- "Two deaths" (dissolution, crystallization) need formal definition.
- The Synthesis mentions `fold ∘ unfold ≈ unfold ∘ fold (mod Press)` — commutation up to remainder. This is unproven and possibly deep.

---

### VI.2 Remainder
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ✅ Canonical | `01_concepts/Remainder.md` |
| Agda | ⚠️ Partial | `sideRem = Neither + Unres` defined; remainder dynamics unproven |
| DSL | ⚠️ Partial | |
| Audit | ✅ Tracked | SPEC-REM-001 |

**Open Questions**:
- Two types: trace remainder (from the cut event) and residual remainder (from fold). Are these formally distinct in the Agda?
- Remainder as "fuel" for the next cycle. But how does remainder drive unfold? This coupling is unformalized.
- "No remainder → death by closure." Can this be proven?

---

## VII. HIGHER CONCEPTS

### VII.1 Plasticity / The Plastic Self
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ✅ Canonical | `01_concepts/Plasticity.md`, `01_concepts/The Plastic Self.md` |
| Agda | ⚠️ Structure only | `Mechanics/Plasticity.agda` — PlasticParams, PlasticSelf defined; no theorems |
| DSL | ❌ Missing | |
| Audit | ❌ Untracked | |

**Open Questions**:
- S → S+1 is the core plastic transformation. What is its type signature? The theory says it changes *admissibility conditions*, not just attributes. Formally, this is a change in the fold operator itself. But the Agda doesn't have fold-operator-as-parameter.
- Plasticity requires T-failure (if □φ → φ held, there'd be no interval for transformation). This connection exists theoretically but isn't proven as a formal dependency.

---

### VII.2 Identity-as-Theory
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ✅ Canonical | `01_concepts/Identity-as-Theory.md` |

### VII.3 Prospective Necessity
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ✅ Canonical | `01_concepts/Prospective Necessity.md` |
| Agda | ✅ Via T-failure | T-failure proof establishes □φ ∧ ¬φ is satisfiable |
| DSL | ❌ Missing | |

## VIII. APPLICATIONS AND EXTENSIONS

### VIII.1 AI / LLM Phenomenology
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ⚠️ Draft | `drafts/LLM Phenomenology.md`, `drafts/Alignment as attractor engineering.md` |
| Agda | ❌ Missing | |
| DSL | ❌ Missing | |
| Audit | ❌ Untracked | |

**Scattered Insights**:
- Bonn abstract: "Irrationality as recursive pressure" — both human and LLM irrationality arise when systems amplify incompatible signals faster than stabilization can resolve. Irrationality = recursion problem, not epistemic failure.
- Folding with the Machine: Human-AI interaction as recursive co-construction. Prompting as architecture. "Stale necessity" = residue without metabolic labor.
- UNILOG Two Regimes: Empirical bimodal separation in LLM reasoning. Selective regime (convergent, AULC > 1.1) vs. exploratory (sustained ambiguity, AULC < 0.6). Gap of 0.548, Cohen's d ≈ 4.0. This is real data.
- Hong Kong abstract: Over-visibility and structured opacity. "Remainder-aware memory" and "opacity budgets" as design principles.
- Ca' Foscari abstract: Over-visibility as recursive attention effect. "The invisible is what attention has rendered too smooth to question."

### VIII.2 Cultural / Social Applications
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ⚠️ Scattered | `drafts/Memetics revised.md`, `drafts/Social Kinds.md`, `drafts/Baudrillard reframe.md` |
| Agda | ❌ Missing | |
| DSL | ❌ Missing | |
| Audit | ❌ Untracked | |

**Scattered Insights**:
- Memetics rehabilitated: Memes were tracking distinction dynamics, not idea transmission.
- Baudrillard: Not collapse of distinction but distinction without consequence — "cuts without depth."
- Diffractions abstract: Self-censorship as narrative's founding operation. Narrative cuts simultaneity into sequence. Remainder = excluded threads.
- AI & Society abstract: "Scientia of relation" — fact and value as co-generated by the same cut/fold/remainder operation. Design criteria: traceability of reentry, reserved remainder, intrinsic evaluation.

### VIII.3 Physics Connections
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ⚠️ Scattered | Physics abstract, New Insight notes, Synthesis §3.10 |
| Agda | ❌ Missing | |
| DSL | ❌ Missing | |
| Audit | ❌ Untracked | |

**Scattered Insights**:
- "Self as Measurement" abstract: Cut parallels quantum measurement. Superposition → multiplicity of pre-cut field. Decoherence → stabilization via fold. Interference patterns → shimmer/remainder.
- Synthesis: Level -2 is quantum field with block time. Measurement/decoherence is unfold at -2→-1.
- "Time is produced by fold at each level" — if taken seriously, this implies something about the physics of time.
- FEP dual: Previous conversation identified symbolics as potentially the "symbolic dual of the Free Energy Principle." The structural parallel: minimize surprise (FEP) ↔ minimize commitment instability (symbolics). Both describe systems that stabilize under pressure. Unexplored.
- Quantum mechanics: "Shimmer" as residual interference. Bistable perception ↔ decoherence timescales. The claim is structural, not reductive.

### VIII.4 Phenomenological Applications
| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Theory | ⚠️ Scattered across drafts | `drafts/Attention.md`, `drafts/Gestalt.md`, `drafts/Insight.md`, `drafts/Trauma.md` |
| Agda | ❌ Missing | |
| DSL | ❌ Missing | |
| Audit | ❌ Untracked | |

**Scattered Insights**:
- NTNU abstract: Attention as fold. Perception is "reentry of sensation into itself." Not spotlight but recursive operation. Two phases: Cut (delimitation) + Reentry (return to field).
- York abstract: "Shimmer" = experiential trace of ineffability. Structural remainder of any distinction. Connects to: acquaintance, Mary's room, musical absorption.
- Synthesis §12.5: Complete circuit diagram S₋₂ → S₀ → S₁ → S₂ → S₃ → S₄ → S₅ → S₆, with S₅ projecting filter back to Fold₋₁. This is the most complete theoretical picture but exists only in the Synthesis.

| Agda | ❌ Missing | |
| DSL | ❌ Missing | |
| Audit | ❌ Untracked | |

**Scattered Insights**:
- Freedom is not escape from necessity but inhabitation of prospective necessity—traversing the gap through one's own metabolic labor.
- Ethics operates at the value level, shaping which configurations are stable.
- Synthesis §12.5.6: "Politics of filter capture" — controlling someone's identity-theory controls their perception. Deepest form of paternalism.

## XI. AUDIT INTEGRATION NOTES

The existing compatibility audit (symbolics-audit/) tracks 61 specs with 44/45 GREEN. It checks *alignment* between layers. This completeness map extends it by:

1. Tracking concepts the audit doesn't cover (hierarchies, applications, scattered insights)
2. Identifying theoretical claims with no formal correlate at all
3. Flagging foundational questions (logic substrate) that affect everything
4. Capturing insights from abstracts/notes that should feed back into the vault

**Recommendation**: The audit registry should be extended to include:
- A "completeness" field (does this spec cover all relevant theoretical claims?)
- A "foundational dependency" field (is this spec's validity contingent on unresolved foundational questions?)
- Links to this completeness map for context
