# --- THEORY SUMMARY (update after each reframe) ---
theory_summary: >
  PRESSURE is the true primitive — created by value, what matters. Initially need, later desire.
  INDEX is the organism's orientation to the world: implicit in animals/babies, explicit in symbolic systems.
  A MEDIUM is a type of index (photography, language, paint each have scope, locus, resolution, measurement).
  DISTINCTION emerges when two systems under shared pressure coordinate — one's differentiation becomes
  legible to the other. The first distinction isn't made but RECOGNIZED. Transmissibility is a two-body
  problem, not one-body sophistication. Distinction is inherently social at origin (though not linguistic).
  DISTINCTION IS REPRESENTATION — same phenomenon from different angles. Distinction emphasizes the
  partitioning (this, not that); representation emphasizes the partiality (this aspect, not the whole).
  Every partition is partial; every partial capture partitions. Remainder unifies them.
  DISTINCTION IS INHERENTLY RECURSIVE (mise en abyme): each distinction requires an index, each index
  parameter is itself a distinction with its own index, all the way down. No atomic foundation.
  Stabilization is where the recursion is arrested at a level that works under pressure.
  CUT and FOLD are two aspects of every distinction, not two types: cut is distinction-to-field;
  fold is distinction-to-distinction (inclusion). Every distinction is both.
  POLICY is a cluster of folds. When applied, a policy cluster induces an OPERATOR — the stabilization function.
  STABILIZATION is coherence under pressure — an achievement, not a given. INFERENCE is a policy choice.
  REMAINDER is what any distinction excludes — persistent pressure, not waste. Generated at every
  level of the recursion. The field is an infinite, entangled continuum; any distinction is finite.
  UNFOLD is remainder pressing back on folds, the loosening that permits reconfiguration.
  SHIMMER is dual: oscillation at the moment of fold, and trace of remainder's ongoing pressure.
  OPACITY is the gradient of access to the index of a distinction — relational, not intrinsic.
  Tracks access to index, not position in the category.
  Two SOURCES: endogenous (becoming, persistence by fit) and exogenous (drawing, persistence by constraint).
  CONSTRAINT is the general case; POWER is the special case (constraint wielded by an agent for asymmetric benefit).
  Much apparatus has no agent behind it (grammar, infrastructure, accumulated accident).
  CONSTRAINT PRODUCES FIT: the world rearranges around the apparatus until the distinction appears
  to track real joints. De-naturalization is recognizing that fit was produced by constraint.
  Spencer-Brown's "draw a distinction" presupposes power; endogenous distinctions become, not drawn.

# --- WHAT'S FORMALIZED (Agda) ---
formalized_agda:
  - "Conservativity: policy can't introduce distinctions it didn't receive — PROVEN (Core, FDE WorldIndexed)"
  - "Contradiction-preservation: policy can't eliminate contradictions by fiat — PROVEN (Core, FDE WorldIndexed)"
  - "Gap theorem: different policies (selective vs exploratory) produce different outputs — PROVEN"
  - "T-failure: consistency operator is doxastic, not alethic — PROVEN"
  - "Non-explosion: LP policy is paraconsistent — PROVEN"
  - "Idempotence: PROVEN for LP, deferred for WorldIndexed (needs bucket sortedness lemmas)"
  - "Bool subsumption: Cut inclusion check for Bool domain — IMPLEMENTED in Context.agda"
  - "Property counterexamples: Mechanics/Properties/Conjectures.agda documents commutativity/associativity failures"
  - "DSL wiring: Applications/DSL/Runtime/Apply.agda now calls Mechanics.Dynamics.step"

formalization_note: >
  SESSION 8 AGDA AUDIT COMPLETE. Seven parallel domain agents analyzed Core, LP, FDE, LFI, Mechanics,
  Modal, and Applications. Key findings: (1) Conservativity and contradiction-preservation proven in
  multiple domains. (2) LP has proven idempotence; WorldIndexed idempotence deferred pending bucket
  sortedness lemmas. (3) Subsumption check implemented for Bool domain. (4) Properties/Conjectures.agda
  created with explicit counterexamples for property failures. (5) DSL Runtime wired to Mechanics functions.
  All files compile with --safe --without-K.

# --- CURRENT CONTEXT ---
current_context: >
  Session 9 complete. Two major workstreams: (1) Drafted foundational paper "The Two-Body Problem:
  Why Distinction Cannot Emerge Alone" in symbolics-research/Papers/two-body-problem/. Full 9-section
  paper, 6 rounds of Gemini review feedback integrated, 10 objections with replies. Key conceptual
  moves: differentiation vs. distinction, updating vs. contesting, truth vs. success, misuse vs.
  failure, laws vs. rules. (2) Vault active notes updated with major theory reframes: distinction
  is representation (01_Ontology), recursion of distinction / mise en abyme (01_Ontology), medium as
  index (01_Ontology), cut as representation (02_Operations), remainder as what any distinction
  excludes (03_Phenomenology), constraint vs. power reframe (04_Ecology — power is the special case
  of constraint; constraint produces fit; de-naturalization), formalism gap table updated (05_Formalism).
  Remainder Under Feedback paper also in repo. All pushed to GitHub.
