  - id: "one-modality"
    date: "2026-02-06"
    status: "accepted"
    summary: "Collapse two modalities (□ and □_P) into one. Resilience is the measure, not a second kind of necessity."
    context: >
      Session 10 proposed distinguishing □ (topological necessity — invariant under index deformation,
      endogenous, persistence by fit) from □_P (settlement under policy — what the policy produces,
      exogenous, persistence by constraint). The motivation was to (1) ground truth beyond mere stability,
      (2) diagnose paranoid systems (□_P without □), and (3) separate genuine inquiry from computation.
    problem: >
      The theory's own commitments undermine making this a binary: (1) Constraint produces fit — □_P can
      become □ through naturalization, so □ might just be maximally-sedimented □_P. (2) Laws and rules
      are a gradient, not a binary. (3) In lived experience, we don't encounter two kinds of necessity —
      we encounter resistance, surprise, stability-under-pressure. The physical and symbolic worlds are
      entangled; positing two modal realms cuts against this.
    resolution: >
      ONE MODALITY: settlement/stabilization under policy (□_P, or just □). RESILIENCE as the measure:
      how much index/policy perturbation can a distinction survive? Truth = high resilience = the
      distinction tracks something the field supports. Pathology (paranoid system) = low resilience =
      stability purchased by narrowing the index, avoiding pressure. "Topological necessity" was a
      reification of the high-resilience limit, not a separate kind of necessity. The field contributes
      PRESSURE, not a second modality. Policies that accommodate pressure are resilient.
    paranoid_system_reframe: >
      The paranoid system is better diagnosed via distinction/differentiation: the paranoid person is
      differentiating (internal states) but not making distinctions (transmissible, contestable, surviving
      uptake). They fail the two-body test. Their "stability" is solitary — can't survive genuine
      interlocution. This uses existing machinery without adding a new modality.
    implications:
      - "Resolves 'second-box-underdefined' review concern — no second box to define"
      - "Resolves 'resilience-vs-fit' concern — resilience IS the measure of fit (under pressure)"
      - "□_P language can be kept as 'settlement operator' but not contrasted with a separate □"
      - "Truth = convergence point that resilient policies approach (Peircean)"
      - "Inquiry vs computation = whether Layer 4 (update) is active, not two modalities"
      - "05_Formalism needs update: remove two-modality framing"
      - "04_Ecology: naturalization is □_P appearing necessary, not □_P appearing as different-kind-□"

  - id: "dyadic-monadic-resolution"
    date: "2026-02-06"
    status: "accepted"
    summary: "Monadic reasoning is possible because distinction-capacity is dyadic in origin but deployable solo once internalized."
    context: >
      Strongest objection from Gemini: If distinction is constitutively dyadic (requires two systems
      under shared pressure), how can a solitary system reason? Where does the 'no' come from monadically?
    resolution: >
      (1) Distinction-capacity is dyadic in origin — you learn to make distinctions through two-body
      coordination (protoconversation, social referencing, language). The FORM of distinction (contestable,
      revisable, normatively bound) is inherited from this history. (2) Once you have the capacity, you
      can deploy it monadically — but you're deploying a fundamentally social form. The 'no' comes from
      the world's pressure, but your capacity to register that pressure AS CONTESTATION (rather than mere
      causal impact) comes from dyadic history. (3) The solitary reasoner hasn't simulated a second body —
      they've INTERNALIZED one. The capacity for self-correction, for treating your own beliefs as
      contestable, is the trace of dyadic origin. You can argue with yourself because you've argued with
      others. Connects to Vygotsky: inner speech is internalized dialogue.
    key_example: >
      Helen Keller did not have an internal monologue before language acquisition through Anne Sullivan —
      a paradigmatic two-body interaction. The capacity for internal contestation requires dyadic origin.
    implications:
      - "Resolves 'dyadic-monadic-problem' review concern"
      - "Solitary reasoning is derivative but not deficient — it deploys a social form"
      - "Vygotsky is a theoretical ally (inner speech = internalized dialogue)"
      - "Connects to AI question: can AI internalize the dyadic form without genuine two-body history?"

  - id: "layer-5-is-interface"
    date: "2026-02-06"
    status: "accepted"
    summary: "Layer 5 (metabolic evaluation) is not a policy layer but the interface where pressure enters the system."
    context: >
      Gemini objection: "A policy is a set of norms; metabolism is a biological/causal process. If L5
      is part of the policy, it implies the system decides how to feel pressure. But pressure is
      supposed to be objective."
    resolution: >
      Layer 5 is not a policy layer — it's the BOUNDARY CONDITION. It's where policy meets pressure.
      The system doesn't choose how to feel pressure; pressure is what the field contributes. Layer 5
      is the interface where that contribution enters the system. Stratification becomes: Layers 1-4
      are policy proper (index, consequence, conflict-resolution, update) — norms the system operates
      under and can revise. Layer 5 is the INTERFACE — where the field's pressure registers, where
      remainder becomes felt, where the causal world enters the normative system.
    implications:
      - "Resolves 'layer-5-status' review concern"
      - "Preserves pressure as objective (not chosen by system)"
      - "Policy stratification is now 4 layers + interface, not 5 layers"
      - "02_Operations needs update: reframe Layer 5 as boundary/interface"

  - id: "distinction-preservation-metabolic"
    date: "2026-02-06"
    status: "accepted"
    summary: "Distinction-preservation targets metabolic arrest, not just logical explosion. 1984-type regimes are live examples."
    context: >
      Reviewer objection: "Classical explosion without revision" is a straw target — no one holds it.
      Distinction-preservation looks like a constraint invented to rule out an opponent that doesn't exist.
      (Though classical logic isn't quite a straw man — it's that the degenerate case is what no one holds.)
    resolution: >
      The target isn't just explosion but METABOLIC ARREST — any configuration that prevents the
      fold-remainder-unfold-refold cycle from operating. Distinction-preservation means: don't destroy
      the medium's capacity to metabolize. This rules out multiple live pathologies:
      (1) EXPLOSION — destroys by making everything equivalent (classical without revision)
      (2) CRYSTALLIZATION — destroys by refusing unfold (fundamentalisms, rigid ideologies)
      (3) FORCED COHERENCE — destroys by suppressing remainder (1984-type regimes, totalizing systems)
      The 1984 example is paradigmatic: the regime doesn't explode into triviality, it ARRESTS metabolism
      by forcing all remainder back into the official schema. Doublethink is metabolic arrest by design.
    live_targets:
      - "Totalitarian regimes (1984-type forced coherence)"
      - "Fundamentalisms (crystallization, index treated as unrevisable)"
      - "Certain AI alignment approaches (training away uncertainty/contradiction)"
    implications:
      - "Resolves 'constitutive-vs-normative' review concern"
      - "Distinction-preservation has live targets, not just straw men"
      - "Connects to political philosophy: healthy polity = metabolically active"
      - "Reframes the classical logic point: it's not anti-classical, it's anti-degenerate-configuration"

  - id: "layer-2-3-collapse"
    date: "2026-02-06"
    status: "accepted"
    summary: "Collapse Layer 3 (conflict-resolution) into Layer 2 (consequence). Conflict resolution is modal structure within consequence."
    context: >
      Gemini: "In most non-monotonic logics, the mechanism for resolving conflicts (specificity, priority)
      is integral to the consequence relation itself, not a separate layer." Separating them implies L2
      generates contradictions that L3 cleans up — but that's not how most systems work.
    resolution: >
      Collapse L3 into L2. Conflict resolution is about the RELATIVE STRENGTH of commitments — which
      is modal structure. When φ and ψ conflict, asking "which wins" is asking which has more modal
      force, which is more binding, less defeasible. Consequence relations are INHERENTLY MODAL.
      "What follows from what" is always already about necessity and strength. Priority orderings,
      specificity, exceptions — these are modal structure within the consequence relation, not a
      separate layer above it.
    new_stratification: >
      4 LAYERS + INTERFACE:
      (1) INDEX — what can be distinguished at all
      (2) CONSEQUENCE — what follows from what, including modal structure (relative strength, defeasibility, priority)
      (3) UPDATE — how to revise under pressure (when remainder accumulates)
      (4) INTERFACE — where pressure enters (not a policy layer; boundary condition)
    connection_to_one_modality: >
      This reinforces the one-modality decision: modal character throughout is about STRENGTH OF
      SETTLEMENT. Some things more firmly settled than others. Some commitments defeat others.
      But it's all one kind of thing (settlement) at different strengths — not different kinds of necessity.
    implications:
      - "Resolves 'layer-2-3-collapse' review concern"
      - "Policy stratification is now 4 layers + interface (was 5 layers)"
      - "Layer 2 explicitly includes modal structure"
      - "02_Operations needs major update"

  - id: "hierarchy-unification"
    date: "2026-02-06"
    status: "accepted"
    summary: "Policy stratification and Organizational Hierarchy are the same structure. Index IS the Form/Formula level."
    context: >
      The policy stratification (Index → Consequence → Update) maps directly onto the Organizational
      Hierarchy (Distinction → Form/Formula → Inference → Modality). Level 2 (Form/Formula) always felt
      vacuous — "syntactic binding" was a placeholder. The insight: INDEX is what fills Level 2. The
      index IS the form that distinction takes. Without index, distinction is formless.
    mapping: >
      ORGANIZATIONAL HIERARCHY = POLICY STRATIFICATION (viewed operationally):
      Level 1: Distinction (φ / not-φ) — the primitive, the bare cut
      Level 2: Index (form/formula) — the articulation of distinction (scope, locus, resolution, measurement)
      Level 3: Consequence/Inference — what follows from what (entailment structure)
      Level 4: Modality/Update — states, worlds, revision under pressure
      Level 5+: Identity/Self — recursive self-modeling
    key_insight: >
      Index doesn't sit "under" distinction like a foundation. Index sits "above" distinction like
      ARTICULATION sits above the thing articulated. The hierarchy is about SCOPE OF STABILIZATION
      (what includes what), not transcendental priority (what enables what). Each level includes and
      articulates the level below. Distinction is the THAT; Index is the HOW. Distinction without
      index is raw, unarticulated — a partition without shape. Index gives distinction its usable form.
    result: >
      ONE HIERARCHY with multiple jobs:
      - Organizational view: What is being stabilized at each level
      - Policy view: How the system operates at each level
      - Pathology view: What can go wrong at each level
      The policy stratification was reinventing the organizational hierarchy without recognizing it.
    implications:
      - "Major simplification: one hierarchy, not two parallel structures"
      - "Level 2 (Form/Formula) now has real content: INDEX"
      - "Policy stratification language can be retired or kept as 'operational view' of hierarchy"
      - "01_Ontology and 02_Operations need reconciliation around this unification"
      - "Organizational Hierarchy note in archive should be promoted/revised"

  - id: "dissolution-vs-gradient"
    date: "2026-02-06"
    status: "accepted"
    summary: "Inference is not dissolved but placed — it IS Level 3 (consequence) in the unified hierarchy."
    context: >
      Gemini noted rhetorical tension between "dissolving" inference and placing it on a "gradient."
      If it's a region, the category exists. If dissolved, the term should be abandoned.
    resolution: >
      Given the hierarchy unification, inference is simply PLACED, not dissolved. Inference IS Level 3
      (consequence/entailment). It's not a distinct kind of cognitive act — it's operations at the
      consequence level of the hierarchy. The term remains useful for picking out Level 3 operations,
      but the boundaries with adjacent levels are vague and the category is not fundamental.
    implications:
      - "Resolves 'dissolution-vs-gradient' review concern"
      - "Clarifies rhetoric: reconceptualization, not elimination"

  - id: "token-form-skip"
    date: "2026-02-06"
    status: "rejected"
    summary: "Distinction-token vs distinction-form terminology not useful — risks reintroducing epistemic/ontological dualism."
    context: >
      ChatGPT suggested separating distinction-token (what operator manipulates) from distinction-form
      (the constituted capacity). This gestures at distinction being both epistemic and ontological.
    resolution: >
      The theory's position is that this split doesn't hold. Distinction is representation; representation
      is distinction. The epistemic and ontological are entangled — distinctions aren't discovered (pure
      ontology) or invented (pure epistemology), they EMERGE through pressure meeting field. The hierarchy
      handles it: Level 1 (distinction) and Level 2 (index) are both ontological AND epistemic. The
      token/form terminology risks reintroducing a dualism the theory has dissolved.
    implications:
      - "No new terminology needed"
      - "Confirms anti-dualist stance on epistemic/ontological"

  - id: "settlement-not-necessity"
    date: "2026-02-06"
    status: "accepted"
    summary: "□_P is a process modality (settlement/closure), not Kripkean necessity."
    context: >
      ChatGPT: "□_P stops behaving like necessity and starts behaving like a temporal next/future
      fixed point operator." Given one-modality decision, this is already resolved.
    resolution: >
      The single modality is best understood as a PROCESS MODALITY — what the system will converge on
      under this policy. Not "necessity" (what holds in all possible worlds) but SETTLEMENT (what the
      policy commits you to). It's prospective. T-failure (□φ without φ) is the gap between commitment
      and realization — a temporal structure, not a logical anomaly.
    terminology: >
      Prefer "settlement" or "closure" over "necessity." Acknowledge process/temporal character.
    implications:
      - "Resolves '□_P is temporal' review concern"
      - "Aligns with one-modality decision"
      - "Papers should use settlement/closure language"

  - id: "policy-fixity-gradient"
    date: "2026-02-06"
    status: "accepted"
    summary: "The gradient is POLICY FIXITY, not constraint. Constraint and fixity are orthogonal."
    context: >
      Gemini: Artists/poets operate under massive formal constraints but low policy fixity (rules
      change during the act). Deduction has high policy fixity. The "constraint gradient" was imprecise.
    resolution: >
      Two orthogonal axes:
      - CONSTRAINT: How strict the rules are
      - POLICY FIXITY: How resistant the policy is to revision during the act
      What distinguishes types of inference/distinction-making is FIXITY, not constraint.
      Examples:
      - High constraint, high fixity: Deduction (strict rules, held fixed)
      - High constraint, low fixity: Formal art (sonnet, fugue — strict rules that can be revised mid-work)
      - Low constraint, low fixity: Free improvisation, paradigm shift
    implications:
      - "Resolves 'policy-fixity-not-constraint' review concern"
      - "Relabel gradient axis in papers"
      - "Clarifies that art can be highly constrained but low-fixity"

  - id: "remainder-not-parametric"
    date: "2026-02-06"
    status: "accepted"
    summary: "Remainder is constitutive/structural, not parametric. It doesn't reduce to a single measurable proxy."
    context: >
      ChatGPT requested: "Make remainder operational — give remainder at least one measurable proxy."
    resolution: >
      Remainder is WHAT DISTINCTION LEAVES OUT — the infinite field minus the finite cut. It's
      constitutive, not parametric. You can't measure "everything that was excluded" because it's
      defined by not being captured. You can see remainder's EFFECTS (pressure to revise, prediction
      error, contradictions, sensitivity to perturbation) but these are effects, not remainder itself.
      Remainder is the structural fact that any distinction is finite and the field is infinite.
      This is like asking for a measurable proxy for "the unconscious" or "the thing-in-itself" —
      the concept is defined by what escapes capture. The formal story should show how remainder
      MANIFESTS (through effects) without pretending it can be directly measured.
    implications:
      - "Resolves 'remainder-operational' review concern"
      - "Remainder is structural, not a parameter"
      - "Papers should show remainder's effects, not claim to measure it directly"
      - "This is a feature of the concept, not a gap in the theory"

  - id: "book-not-papers"
    date: "2026-02-06"
    status: "accepted"
    summary: "The theory needs a book to hold its shape, not papers that respond to existing conversations."
    context: >
      The "Inference as Policy" paper started as being about inference, then inference dissolved into
      Level 3 of the hierarchy. Making it "inference-themed" centers old ways of thinking and does
      nothing to establish symbolics as a new field. Papers respond to existing conversations on their
      terms; a book holds the theory's own shape.
    resolution: >
      The theory needs BOOK-SHAPED development, not paper-shaped. A book:
      - Builds from foundations
      - Each piece has its place relative to the whole
      - External concerns become applications OF the theory, not drivers of it
      - Establishes symbolics as a coherent field
      Papers can come later as applications/engagements, but the shape-holding form is the book.
    implications:
      - "Deprioritize paper revisions"
      - "Focus on building the book's spine"
      - "Existing paper drafts may become chapters or application sections"

      I. PRESSURE
         - The primitive: what matters, value, need
         - Pressure before distinction (pre-symbolic)
         - Why pressure, not distinction, is the true ground

      II. DISTINCTION
         - Genesis (speculative): traumatic/scapegoat origin hypothesis — kept here as high-risk speculation
         - Two-body emergence: necessary conditions
         - Differentiation vs distinction
         - The cut as wound (the Fall, irreversibility)

      III. THE NATURE OF DISTINCTION
         - Remainder (what any distinction leaves out — constitutive, structural not parametric)
         - Index (form, articulation, orientation)
         - Opacity (gradient access to index)
         - Epistemic = ontological (anti-dualist)
         - Distinction as representation (the identity)

      IV. HIERARCHY
         - The unified organizational hierarchy
         - Level 1: Distinction (the bare cut)
         - Level 2: Index (form, articulation)
         - Level 3: Consequence (inference, entailment)
         - Level 4: Modality (update, revision, strength)
         - Level 5-6: Identity and the plastic self
         - Each level is the same operation at broader scope

      V. METABOLISM
         - The dynamics: fold → remainder → unfold → refold
         - Stabilization and settlement (process modality)
         - T-failure: commitment before realization
         - Resilience as the measure of truth

      VI. SELF
         - Need vs desire (pressure before and after the Fall)
         - Memory (persistence of folds)
         - Hope (T-failure lived)
         - Risk (vulnerability to unfold)
         - Creativity (low policy-fixity distinction-making)
         - The plastic self (trajectory of self-reorganizations)

      VII. WORLD
         - Fit and constraint (endogenous/exogenous)
         - Naturalization (constraint appearing as topology)
         - Power (constraint with an agent)
         - Applications: social ontology, AI, politics, etc.
    genesis_note: >
      Genesis (the scapegoat/traumatic origin hypothesis) is kept within Distinction as speculative.
      The hypothesis: distinction emerged from a traumatic event for a community where partitioning
      became a matter of survival — potentially a scapegoat structure, a mass death event. This would
      explain why distinction is "wounding," why remainder is constitutive (the expelled IS the remainder),
      why desire is structured by loss. High-risk but generative. May be strengthened over time.

        the topology (□). The Paranoid System example highlights this: the paranoia is resilient

    date: "2026-02-04"
    status: "accepted"
    summary: >
      Inference is not a distinct category of act. All distinction-making is inferential to the
      degree that it is responsive to the pre-given field (physical continuum + symbolic apparatus).
      The difference between deduction, abduction, and creative work is a gradient of constraint,
      not a difference of kind. Deduction is maximally constrained (topologically necessary relative
      to input + policy). Abduction is heavily constrained (remainder-shaped). Poetry is loosely
      constrained. Fabrication/lying is deliberately non-responsive to the field — a pragmatic
      phenomenon, not a structural category of the theory.
    implications:
      - "The inference/distinction-making binary in Inference as Policy paper dissolves"
      - "Conservativity becomes a gradient property of policies, not a constitutive binary"
      - "The metabolism (fold/remainder/unfold/refold) is the real primitive, not 'inference'"
      - "Abduction is not a 'hybrid' — it is distinction-making under remainder pressure, feeding new stabilization"

  - id: "truth-as-topological-necessity"
    date: "2026-02-04"
    status: "accepted"
    summary: >
      Truth is topological necessity: a distinction is true to the degree it tracks features of the
      field that are invariant under deformation of the index. The field (infinite, entangled continuum)
      has topological structure — ridges, joints, features that any reasonable index would approximate.
      Endogenous distinctions track this structure (persistence by fit). Resilience under policy/index
      perturbation is the measure of truth. This does the work that conservativity-as-constitutive was
      trying to do, but anchored in the field's structure rather than in operator properties.
    implications:
      - "Replaces binary conservativity as the normative anchor"

    date: "2026-02-04"
    status: "accepted"
    summary: >
      Distinction-preservation (don't destroy the medium of distinction) is constitutive of ALL
      distinction-making, not just inference. Classical explosion without revision is pathological
      regardless of where on the constraint gradient the distinction-making sits. This is the one
      property that survives the dissolution of the inference/distinction-making binary as truly
      constitutive rather than gradient.

  - id: "policy-stratification"
    date: "2026-02-04"
    status: "accepted"
    summary: >
      Policy has a five-layer stratification. The layers are ontologically homogeneous (all are folds /
      inclusion relations) but play structurally different ROLES with a presupposition ordering:
      (1) INDEX policy — defines the representational space (what can be distinguished at all). Upstream
      of everything. (2) CONSEQUENCE policy — operates within the space the index defines; determines
      what follows from what. Different logics differ here. (3) CONFLICT-RESOLUTION policy — governs
      consequence folds when they disagree; priority orderings, lex specialis, exceptions. Folds about
      folds. (4) UPDATE policy — governs the unfold phase; when stabilization produces too much remainder,
      how does the system revise? AGM, paradigm shift, DSM revision cycle. (5) METABOLIC EVALUATION —
      how remainder gets registered as pressure; the metabolism itself operating on the whole stack.
    structural_properties:
      - "Presupposition ordering: each layer presupposes the ones below it"
      - "Dynamic entanglement: each layer can put pressure on every other through the metabolic cycle"
      - "Independent interveneability: you can vary one layer while holding others fixed (connects to Woodward)"
      - "Ontological homogeneity: all layers are folds, but play structurally different roles"
    gradient_of_constraint: >
      The gradient of constraint in rational activity maps to how many layers are simultaneously varied.
      Deduction = 1 layer (consequence, with index and priorities fixed). Abduction = 2 layers
      (consequence + proposing new folds). Paradigm shift = all layers (index itself being revised).
      Creative distinction-making = maximum layers, maximum degrees of freedom.
    precedent_analysis: >
      NOVEL SYNTHESIS, not rediscovery. No single framework has this structure, but strong partial
      precedents exist. CLOSEST MATCHES: (1) Ostrom's IAD framework — most precise match for 3 of 5
      layers (constitutional/collective-choice/operational rules with presupposition ordering + dynamic
      feedback). Missing revision and metabolic layers. (2) Beer's VSM — five subsystems mapping
      suggestively onto five layers, also recursive, but functional assignments differ and lacks gradient
      principle. (3) Bateson's Levels of Learning — presupposition ordering maps well, but Bateson's
      levels are strictly hierarchical (no dynamic entanglement). STRONG PARTIAL PRECEDENTS:
      Tarski/type-theoretic universes (presupposition + ontological homogeneity, but static);
      Smith's reflective tower/3-LISP (presupposition + entanglement + homogeneity, but infinite/
      undifferentiated); Meadows' leverage points (stratified intervention depth, but ranking not
      presupposition). GENUINELY NOVEL elements: (a) gradient-of-constraint principle (number of layers
      varied = type of rational activity) — no precedent found; (b) presupposition ordering AND dynamic
      entanglement simultaneously — Tarski has former without latter, Ashby has latter without former;
      (c) ontological homogeneity combined with functional differentiation into specific layers.

    summary: >
      The regress objection ("who applies the policy?") dissolves under the policy stratification.
      The application of a policy IS causal/automatic — the system runs the policy like a machine
      runs a program. Normativity does not live in the atomic act of application. It lives in the
      REVISABILITY of the policy: Layer 4 (update) can rewrite Layers 1-3 when remainder accumulates.
      The regress terminates in Layer 5 (metabolic evaluation) — pressure from the field's causal
      structure. The law/rule distinction doesn't live in whether execution is automatic or judged;
      it lives in whether the system that operates under the constraint can also revise it. Particles
      can't revise gravity (law). Thinkers can revise their logic (rule). This is the structural
      difference. Needs explicit statement in the paper, but no further theoretical work required.

  - id: "two-modalities"
    date: "2026-02-04"
    status: "accepted"
    summary: >
      The paper conflates two distinct modalities that the theory needs to separate.
      (1) TOPOLOGICAL NECESSITY (□): φ is invariant under deformation of the index. The field has
      structure — ridges, joints, features — that any reasonable index would approximate. This is
      genuine necessity, grounded in the physical world's topology. Earns the name. Maps onto
      ENDOGENOUS source (persistence by fit, governed by laws).
      (2) SETTLEMENT UNDER POLICY (□_P): φ holds at the fixed point the current policy produces.
      Prospective — what the policy commits you to. Closer to a "next-state" or "eventually"
      operator. Maps onto EXOGENOUS source (persistence by constraint, governed by rules).
    t_failure_at_both_levels: >
      T-failure (□φ ∧ ¬φ) operates at both levels but means different things.
      Topological: the field determines φ but the current index hasn't found it (epistemic gap —
      the space of genuine inquiry). Settlement: the policy determines φ but the system hasn't
      computed it yet (computational gap — stabilization in progress).
    divergence_cases: >
      □_P φ without □φ = policy holds φ but φ isn't topologically real. The PARANOID SYSTEM:
      perfectly stable under its policy, tracking nothing in the field. Also: sedimented categories
      that look natural but are held by constraint.
      □φ without □_P φ = φ is topologically real but current policy can't capture it. The space
      of GENUINE INQUIRY: the field has structure your stabilization hasn't found.
    ecology_connection: >
      Maps directly onto 04_Ecology's two sources. Endogenous/fit/laws = □ (topological necessity).
      Exogenous/constraint/rules = □_P (settlement under policy). NATURALIZATION is the general term
      for □_P φ appearing as □φ — constraint appearing as topology, through any mechanism that makes
      the constraint's index opaque. De-naturalization is the reverse: recognizing apparent □φ as □_P φ.
      SEDIMENTATION is demoted to the specific slow-temporal-burial case of naturalization. Other
      mechanisms of naturalization: complexity (the apparatus is too intricate to see through),
      power asymmetry (those who impose retain index access, those who live under do not), simply
      not being told. Timescale is empirically contingent; what matters structurally is opacity of
      the constraint's index.
    implications:
      - "Paper's current □ should be renamed to □_P (settlement operator)"
      - "Topological necessity (□) introduced as genuine modality grounded in the field"
      - "Paranoia problem fully resolved: paranoid system has □_P without □"

    summary: >
      The paper claims neutrality between LP and classical logic but the distinction-preservation
      argument effectively argues against pure classical logic. The fix: own the position explicitly.
      The theory is not neutral between all possible logic choices. It rules out any TOTAL CONFIGURATION
      of the policy stack that destroys distinction. But it doesn't privilege LP over classical-with-revision.
    resolution: >
      LP and classical logic differ in WHERE they handle contradiction within the five-layer stratification:
      (1) LP builds contradiction-tolerance into LAYER 2 (consequence). Both φ and ¬φ persist without explosion.
      (2) Classical + AGM builds contradiction-elimination into LAYER 4 (update). Consequence explodes, but
      the update policy intervenes before explosion propagates — revises premises, retracts beliefs.
      Both preserve distinction. Both sustain the medium. They distribute the work differently across the stack.
      What FAILS distinction-preservation is classical logic WITH NO REVISION CAPACITY — a system that explodes
      on contradiction and has no Layer 4 to catch it. That's not anti-classical; it's anti-degenerate.
    further_implication: >
      Classical logic's historical development of revision theories (AGM, non-monotonic extensions, default
      reasoning) is, from the theory's perspective, the natural emergence of Layer 4 when Layer 2 is intolerant
      of contradiction. The system MUST develop update capacity somewhere, or it fails distinction-preservation.
      This is the metabolic cycle operating on the logic itself — an instance of the theory's own dynamics.
    implications:
      - "Paper must stop claiming full neutrality — own the structural constraint"
      - "Target is the STACK configuration, not Layer 2 alone — avoids strawmanning classical logic"
      - "Distinction-preservation is a constraint on the whole stratification, not a preference for LP"
      - "Classical logic's revision-theory history becomes an instance of the metabolic cycle"

# --- THEORY SUMMARY (update after each reframe) ---
theory_summary: >
  PRESSURE is the true primitive — created by value, what matters. Initially need, later desire.
  INDEX is the organism's orientation to the world: implicit in animals/babies, explicit in symbolic systems.
  A MEDIUM is a type of index (photography, language, paint each have scope, locus, resolution, measurement).
  DISTINCTION emerges when two systems under shared pressure coordinate — one's differentiation becomes
  legible to the other. The first distinction isn't made but RECOGNIZED. Transmissibility is a two-body
  problem, not one-body sophistication. Distinction is inherently social at origin (though not linguistic).
  DISTINCTION IS REPRESENTATION — same phenomenon from different angles. Distinction emphasizes the
  partitioning (this, not that); representation emphasizes the partiality (this aspect, not the whole).
  Every partition is partial; every partial capture partitions. Remainder unifies them.
  DISTINCTION IS INHERENTLY RECURSIVE (mise en abyme): each distinction requires an index, each index
  parameter is itself a distinction with its own index, all the way down. No atomic foundation.
  Stabilization is where the recursion is arrested at a level that works under pressure.
  CUT and FOLD are two aspects of every distinction, not two types: cut is distinction-to-field;
  fold is distinction-to-distinction (inclusion). Every distinction is both.
  POLICY is a cluster of folds. When applied, a policy cluster induces an OPERATOR — the stabilization function.
  STABILIZATION is coherence under pressure — an achievement, not a given. INFERENCE is a policy choice.
  REMAINDER is what any distinction excludes — persistent pressure, not waste. Generated at every
  level of the recursion. The field is an infinite, entangled continuum; any distinction is finite.
  UNFOLD is remainder pressing back on folds, the loosening that permits reconfiguration.
  SHIMMER is dual: oscillation at the moment of fold, and trace of remainder's ongoing pressure.
  OPACITY is the gradient of access to the index of a distinction — relational, not intrinsic.
  Tracks access to index, not position in the category.
  Two SOURCES: endogenous (becoming, persistence by fit) and exogenous (drawing, persistence by constraint).
  CONSTRAINT is the general case; POWER is the special case (constraint wielded by an agent for asymmetric benefit).
  Much apparatus has no agent behind it (grammar, infrastructure, accumulated accident).
  CONSTRAINT PRODUCES FIT: the world rearranges around the apparatus until the distinction appears
  to track real joints. De-naturalization is recognizing that fit was produced by constraint.
  Spencer-Brown's "draw a distinction" presupposes power; endogenous distinctions become, not drawn.

  SESSION 8 AGDA AUDIT COMPLETE. Seven parallel domain agents analyzed Core, LP, FDE, LFI, Mechanics,
  Modal, and Applications. Key findings: (1) Conservativity and contradiction-preservation proven in
  multiple domains. (2) LP has proven idempotence; WorldIndexed idempotence deferred pending bucket
  sortedness lemmas. (3) Subsumption check implemented for Bool domain. (4) Properties/Conjectures.agda
  created with explicit counterexamples for property failures. (5) DSL Runtime wired to Mechanics functions.
  All files compile with --safe --without-K.

# --- CURRENT CONTEXT ---
current_context: >
  Session 9 complete. Two major workstreams: (1) Drafted foundational paper "The Two-Body Problem:
  Why Distinction Cannot Emerge Alone" in symbolics-research/Papers/two-body-problem/. Full 9-section
  paper, 6 rounds of Gemini review feedback integrated, 10 objections with replies. Key conceptual
  moves: differentiation vs. distinction, updating vs. contesting, truth vs. success, misuse vs.
  failure, laws vs. rules. (2) Vault active notes updated with major theory reframes: distinction
  is representation (01_Ontology), recursion of distinction / mise en abyme (01_Ontology), medium as
  index (01_Ontology), cut as representation (02_Operations), remainder as what any distinction
  excludes (03_Phenomenology), constraint vs. power reframe (04_Ecology — power is the special case
  of constraint; constraint produces fit; de-naturalization), formalism gap table updated (05_Formalism).
  Remainder Under Feedback paper also in repo. All pushed to GitHub.

# --- RECENT DECISIONS (full history in decision-log.md) ---
recent_decisions:
  - id: "distinction-is-representation"
    date: "2026-02-03"
    summary: "Distinction and representation are the same phenomenon. Distinction emphasizes partitioning; representation emphasizes partiality. Remainder unifies them."
  - id: "recursion-mise-en-abyme"
    date: "2026-02-03"
    summary: "Distinction is inherently recursive: each requires an index, each index parameter is a distinction, all the way down. No atomic foundation. Stabilization arrests the recursion."
  - id: "constraint-vs-power"
    date: "2026-02-03"
    summary: "Power is the special case of constraint (constraint wielded by agent for asymmetric benefit). Much apparatus has no agent. Constraint produces fit; de-naturalization recognizes fit was produced."
  - id: "two-body-paper-drafted"
    date: "2026-02-03"
    summary: "Full draft of Two-Body Problem paper complete with 6 rounds of Gemini review. 9 sections, 10 objections, 3 thematic groups of theoretical allies."
  - id: "truth-vs-success"
    date: "2026-02-03"
    summary: "Key conceptual move: success is a biological constraint (solitary), truth is a social norm (dyadic). Separation of these axes distinguishes differentiation from distinction."
