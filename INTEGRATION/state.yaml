# --- THEORY SUMMARY (update after each reframe) ---
theory_summary: >
  PRESSURE is the true primitive — created by value, what matters. Initially need, later desire.
  INDEX is the organism's orientation to the world: implicit in animals/babies, explicit in symbolic systems.
  DISTINCTION emerges when two systems under shared pressure coordinate — one's differentiation becomes
  legible to the other. The first distinction isn't made but RECOGNIZED. Transmissibility is a two-body
  problem, not one-body sophistication. Distinction is inherently social at origin (though not linguistic).
  Distinction is primitive within the symbolic order, but pressure is prior.
  CUT and FOLD are relations, not operations: cut is distinction-to-field; fold is distinction-to-distinction (inclusion).
  POLICY is a cluster of folds. When applied, a policy cluster induces an OPERATOR — the stabilization function.
  STABILIZATION is coherence under pressure — an achievement, not a given. INFERENCE is a policy choice.
  REMAINDER is what fold excludes — persistent pressure, not waste.
  UNFOLD is remainder pressing back on folds, the loosening that permits reconfiguration.
  SHIMMER is dual: oscillation at the moment of fold, and trace of remainder's ongoing pressure.
  OPACITY is the gradient of access to the index of a distinction — relational, not intrinsic.
  Two SOURCES: endogenous (becoming, persistence by fit) and exogenous (drawing, persistence by force).
  Spencer-Brown's "draw a distinction" presupposes power; endogenous distinctions become, not drawn.

# --- WHAT'S FORMALIZED (Agda) ---
formalized_agda:
  - "Conservativity: policy can't introduce distinctions it didn't receive — PROVEN (Core, FDE WorldIndexed)"
  - "Contradiction-preservation: policy can't eliminate contradictions by fiat — PROVEN (Core, FDE WorldIndexed)"
  - "Gap theorem: different policies (selective vs exploratory) produce different outputs — PROVEN"
  - "T-failure: consistency operator is doxastic, not alethic — PROVEN"
  - "Non-explosion: LP policy is paraconsistent — PROVEN"
  - "Idempotence: PROVEN for LP, deferred for WorldIndexed (needs bucket sortedness lemmas)"
  - "Bool subsumption: Cut inclusion check for Bool domain — IMPLEMENTED in Context.agda"
  - "Property counterexamples: Mechanics/Properties/Conjectures.agda documents commutativity/associativity failures"
  - "DSL wiring: Applications/DSL/Runtime/Apply.agda now calls Mechanics.Dynamics.step"

formalization_note: >
  SESSION 8 AGDA AUDIT COMPLETE. Seven parallel domain agents analyzed Core, LP, FDE, LFI, Mechanics,
  Modal, and Applications. Key findings: (1) Conservativity and contradiction-preservation proven in
  multiple domains. (2) LP has proven idempotence; WorldIndexed idempotence deferred pending bucket
  sortedness lemmas. (3) Subsumption check implemented for Bool domain. (4) Properties/Conjectures.agda
  created with explicit counterexamples for property failures. (5) DSL Runtime wired to Mechanics functions.
  All files compile with --safe --without-K.

# --- CURRENT CONTEXT ---
current_context: >
  Session 9 complete. Drafted foundational paper "The Two-Body Problem: Why Distinction Cannot
  Emerge Alone" in symbolics-research/Papers/two-body-problem/. Full 9-section paper arguing that
  transmissible symbolic form (distinction) is constitutively dyadic. 6 rounds of Gemini review
  feedback integrated. Paper covers: developmental psychology, enculturated apes, experimental
  semiotics, animal communication, waggle dance counterexample, evolutionary framework (including
  self-domestication), 3 thematic groups of theoretical allies (philosophical roots, evolutionary/
  biological, cognitive science/enactivism), and 10 objections with replies. Key conceptual moves:
  differentiation vs. distinction, updating vs. contesting, truth vs. success, misuse vs. failure,
  laws vs. rules. Also created state.yaml in symbolics-research and updated README.
